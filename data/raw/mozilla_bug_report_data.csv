BUGZILLA-294734,"2.16.9 is broken -- many users can't enter bugs on it particularly not from a

SUPPORT.MOZILLA.ORG-398246,"Adding support for custom headers and cookie names involves two steps:
* making session names configurable
* disabling auto-start for sessions

This can be accomplished in tiki-setup_base.php though it means in turn that all pages dependent on the hard-coded PHPSESSID cookie along with the basic session handler all need to be refactored to not assume there is a pre-existing session.

I'm looking at re-implementing some session libs I have from before.  Should do the trick.

This is a chicken/egg problem since we want to use non-default cookie names for NS rules.  We can't have the app auto-setting the cookie while simultaneously passing cache headers.  We need to separate the behavior so it's consistent and predictable for the proxy cache.

ETA is Thurs.  This affect performance and for a couple of reasons it blocks bug 398239.",blocker

after the line that says 'require CGI.pl':

ConnectToDatabase()

The ProcessData function of the nsXBMDecoder class parse the data of an XBM's
format image.
The bug happens during the re-processing of this image format within the
libpr0n a module activated by default :

At [1] endPtr is incremented until the null terminating character if it's
fill by ' ' space.
At [2] mPos is set to endPtr if mIsX10 and hiByte are null. There are option
taken from the XBM format's image.
At [3] mPos is incremented without checking if *mPos is null.
Thus the boucle at [4] can not stop depending on the state of the heap.

I found it is possible to craft such an XBM image to put the heap layout in
a predictable state and exploit the bug reliably.

An attacker could execute arbitrary code on mozilla firefox if a web page is
viewed or even within an e-mail with a IFRAME tag.

As you can see the image end with a space character when the program assume
the image to be clean and contain end tag.
Thus if one is able to control the heap layout it is possible to execute
arbitrary code.

Here is some details on how to exploit the bug on Linux :

- Use a javascript and allocate a lot of 'local' buffer. I found JC_GC is called
at the end of the javascript parsing before any image are loaded and will free
all 'useless' (because local) buffer.
Thus it is easy to 1) Allocate in some global array a lot of *little bufer* to
begin so we have the heap layout in a predictable state (no hole).
2) Allocate a few big buffer with isdigit()-valid character. Because there is no
more heap hole the 'top chunk' of the heap is expended.
3) When JC_GC return some memory have been freed and thus following
allocation will fall in these new heap hole.
4) When the image is processed the overflowed buffer will be followed by
isdigit-character (this is junk in the prev_size field of the next struct
malloc_chunk). Then a '\0' will be written on the LSB of the 'next size' field
of the next struct malloc_chunk on the heap.
Because it is easily possible to inject controlled character on the heap
(actually that could have been done in the few isdigit()-valid buffer) it is
possible to store fake information on the heap and tricks malloc()/free()/etc
to parse them.
Still in the scheme of Doug Lea malloc (linux) this will end by triggering the
macro UNLINK() which basically insert a heap chunk in a linked list thus
writing a controlled pointer of us to a controlled address of us.
One can simply overwrite any function pointer like GOT entry saved %eip
pointer on the stack and hijack it to point to some injected shellcode.

Exploitation is possible on *BSD / Windows aswell.
Actual Results:  
Ability to execute whatever code you want.

SEAMONKEY-208903,"The patch for bug 175881 introudced this problem. (attachment 124826).
The patch has the following line 

-    gStatusBar.label = getSelectedItem().id
+    gStatusBar.label = getFileForItem(getSelectedItem()).path

The noticable change introduced by this is that the status bar shows 'garbage'
characters for non-ASCII file names. Going back to 
|getSelectedItem().id| (chopping off 'file://' at the beginning if necessary)
will solve this 'UI' regression. However that's not touching the root cause of
the problem because none of command buttons is functional (all of them is dimmed
out) when a non-ASCII file is  selected  with or without the change. The file
operation in other parts of Mozilla work fine so that nsIFile and nsILocalFile
are not to blame. [1]

getFileForItem() is defined in 
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/components/download-manager/resources/downloadmanager.js#357
as
357 function getFileForItem(aElement)
358 {
359   var itemResource = gRDFService.GetUnicodeResource(aElement.id)
360   var fileResource = gDownloadView.database.GetTarget(itemResource
gNC_File true)
361   fileResource =
fileResource.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFResource)
362   return createLocalFile(fileResource.Value)
363 }
364 
365 function createLocalFile(aFilePath) 
366 {


I added a couple of 'dump()' statements in createLocalFile(aFilePath) and
printed out |aFilePath).  aFilePath is zero-extended UTF-8. For instance 
U+00A0 (in UTF-8 it's 0xC2 0x80) aFilePath should have 'U+00A0'. Instead it
has 'U+00C2 U+0080'. This symptom suggests that somewhere in RDF-related code
ACString is used where AUTF8String should have been used. 

[1] Recently I've been working on enabling 'Unicode' file I/O in Windows (bug
162361) and with that enabled Mozilla-Windows has the same problem as Linux
under UTF-8 locale. Therefore I think this is an XP issue althouhg I'm filing
this under Linux for now.",major

On the test page the border on the top and left sides of the table disappears.
It actually appears as if the border disappears halfway in under the
content/background och the cells. If the border is 4px wide 2 pixels will be
visible at all sides of the table. If the border is 2px wide 1 pixel will be
visible at all sides etc. 1 pixel obviously becomes either 1 or 0 pixels.

Without border-collapse: collapse everything works as expected.

1. Load the test page.

The HTTP ACCEPT header is not preserved when after a GET redirect. That leads that the second GET is not using the original HTTP ACCEPT header but is reset to the standard.

This is a really important feature for the proper implementation of RESTful architectures. I'm currently developing some RESTful prototypes and this feature is a must when dealing with aliasing of resources for instance in order to access resources by their ID or any other resource key field (as its unique name). The problem is that the http accept header in particular is very important to determine the proper format to de-reference to the resource to (as when using Ruby on Rails respond_to in order to determine the content-type to respond with).

consist of the Try again-Link which doesn´t even work.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Enable error pages (user_pref(browser.xul.error_pages.enabled true))

user_pref(capability.principal.codebase.p0.granted UniversalXPConnect)
user_pref(capability.principal.codebase.p0.id http://bugzilla.mozilla.org)

5. See the page with only the Try again link in it.

When you try the same without the both capability.principal.codebase.* lines in

This UI is the official one we are going to release in Bugzilla 3.0. mconnor told me yesterday this was probably due to a reflow bug (-> CC'ing dbaron and roc) on the Mozilla 1.8 branch and that it was probably fixed on trunk. He also told me it was very unlikely to see it fixed on the 1.8 branch.

The problem is that Fx2 is the current stable browser not Fx3a2 and Bugzilla belongs to Mozilla and so releasing a product which doesn't display correctly with another Mozilla product looks really non-professional.

Tonight I lost my entire Mozilla 1.7 RC1 profile in Windows XP and Mac OS X
10.3.3.  The symptom is where you exit Mozilla 1.7 RC1 and it hangs in memory
for a while.  This deleted the \Profile and onward path.

In Windows XP you have to open the Windows XP Task Manager click on Processes
highlight mozilla.exe and click End Process.

In Mac OS X 10.3.3 you right-click on the Mozilla icon on the Dock wait a few
seconds for the pop-up menu to display and click Forced Quit.

If Mozilla 1.7 RC1 continues to hang where it will not completely exit from
memory (or stop running) this completely deletes the Mozilla profile if more
than one profile it will remove all profiles.

I could not find any corrupted files that I checked the address book message
filters message files I deleted all *.msf files and built them back by
clicking on each mail folder etc.

I stumbled on this problem/bug recently but I thought I had done something
wrong or something was running on the system that caused it to occur.  Now I see
the symptom that makes an entire Mozilla profile to delete. 

Update....

In Mozilla 1.7 RC1 click Edit | Mail and Newsgroups Account Settings click on
Server Settings click Advanced in the IMAP tab unselect 'Use IDLE command if
the server supports it'.  Click OK and OK to return to Mozilla Mail.

Mozilla 1.7 RC1 Mail no longer hangs on exit where it deletes the Profile
directory so far.

Mozilla again the entire Mozilla profile has been deleted.

I'll attach the source. I don't have a generic Makefile for it. But it is only
one .c file that builds as a standalone executable that uses only spidermonkey
and nspr. It creates one JSRuntime and a bunch of threads that each create a
JSContext and loop through the evaluation of scripts each containing a bunch of
randomly generated identifiers (all within JS requests).

The scripts currently look like...

function FOO {var FOO_1 var FOO_2}
function BAR {var BAR_1 var BAR_2}
FOO()
BAR()

Of course it creates a ton of those lines. And the identifier lengths are also
randomized.

I believe that my test code represents a valid use of the api and that all
scripts are themselves valid.

I've seen this test fail in a few ways:

1) Crash in js_AllocGCThing (jsgc.c:479) where rt->gcFreeList is equal to 1 (but
should be a valid pointer or NULL). This *seems* to happen when one or more
other threads are doing last ditch GCs. I've seen this a number of times.

2) A ReferenceError reported by the error reporter (e.g. ReferenceError: FOO
is not defined). The identifier in question in these cases in shown as text by
the error reporter. It is always actually a valid identifier that is in the
script (the test code guarantees that - and I've  validated the script contents
in some of these cases to be sure). This error indicates that the interpreter
failed to find an atom at runtime that it absolutely should have found. I've
seen this a bunch of times. This *might* indicate a corrupted atom.

3) A crash in QuoteString (jsopcode.c:402) called by
js_AtomToPrintableString in the case where the interpreter is trying to build
the string to report a ReferenceError (as above). This looks like a case where
the atom that the interpreter is trying to lookup is not only not found as a
property but that the atom used for the search actually represents a bogus
JSString while the interpreter is still trying to use it. I've seen this once so
far.

There are a bunch of #defines at the top for thread counts GC frequency
identifier length etc. I've been twiddling this stuff a lot and seeing
different effects. This test is just a quick hack at this point.

I'm hopeful that this will help in figuring out problems we've been seeing. And
that this might be a starting point for a multithreaded smoketest (at least).",critical

I created a folder named ~FromHome~.  It worked fine. I created a filter and it
moved a bunch of email into the new folder. 

When I restarted Mozilla the folder did not appear. The files are in my home

May be recoverable by renaming the email files....I will try it.

Removing an autocomplete textbox with an active results popup breaks all autocomplete functionality browser-wide.

This occurs with any autocomplete textbox not just rich-text search history ones. It's possible to reproduce the error without the popup box being open (though still by removing the textbox) but this is the most reliable method.

This has been an issue on the trunk since at least September 2006.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install attached XPI.
2. Load chrome://autocompletebreaker/content/test.xul
3. Click top textbox enter a letter so some autocomplete results show in the popup list press the down arrow to select one of the results (without hitting Enter) and click outside the textbox. The top textbox should disappear due to a removeChild() call in the blur() handler.
4. Click in the second textbox.


Actual Results:  
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... Component does not have requested interface arg 0 [nsIAutoCompleteController.input]  nsresult: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)  location: JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/autocomplete.xml :: attachController :: line 265  data: no]

Autocomplete is then broken program-wide and the address bar no longer functions.

I don't know if this is the cause of all the time I've had a desired tab close when I wasn't expecting it but it's a confirmed cause of many of them and needs fixing.

Suppose you open a new tab. A blank tab appears and the focus is taken to the address bar for entry of the desired address. Whilst entering the address you decide actually you don't need that page after all. So you close it with the normal key combination for close tab.

Then not only your new blank tab is closed but also the NEXT tab is closed as well. If you only had one tab open prior to the above FF itself shuts down too.

It is obvious that logically what has happened is that the edge case where the current tab is newly displayed blank but no web page has yet loaded into it is not correctly processed in the close tab function.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See above.
Actual Results:  
See above. 
A second tab is closed that was not directed to be closed. Data is lost.

Expected Results:  
Existing valid tabs should not close when the current tab is closed.

I have also had many cases (harder to reproduce) where a current tab being worked on has closed and pathologically a second previous tab has closed too. Most of these were not new tabs. So probably there is a second bug in this function with similar effect. Please when rechecking this function look for other cases by which a 2nd tab might accidentally be closed when the close-tab function is used.",minor

If a tree is built from an XML template without flags=dont-build-content and a sort attribute is added to the columns clicking on the column header three times (i.e. to return to the Natural sort order) will crash the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a tree from an XML template but don't add flags=dont-build-content
2. Add appropriate sort attributes to the treecol elements
3. Load the page in Firefox and click on a column header
Actual Results:  
Initially the data are shown unsorted (natural order).
The first click causes them to be sorted in ascending order.
The second click causes them to be sorted in descending order.
The third click causes the browser to crash.

Expected Results:  
The data should be returned to their original unsorted order. At the very least it shouldn't cause the whole browser to crash.

But only DB::FetchSQLData clears $_fetchahead after each call meaning that

effectively considering some results of the query.

Consider the following case:

my $result1 = (MoreSQLData())? 1 : 0  # $result1 = 1

I'm attaching a patch to update Hunspell to 1.1.11 as a checkpoint but I'm going to hold off on requesting review until 1.1.12 is release which Nemeth tells me is forthcoming.

What's new in 1.1.9 - 1.1.11:
-Fix for OpenSolaris build issue
-Fix for VC7.1 build issue
-Fix for Mingw build issue
-New phonetic transition table allowing for spelling recommendations to be made on words with more than one letter swapped (ie. htne -> then & htikn -> think)
-Other various bug fixes (see the release notes at http://hunspell.sf.net for more info)

A few theories off the top of my head:
* too many slaves on one master is making Buildbot lose some
* the new vlan is configured in such a way that it's causing this
* the new slaves somehow have a different version of buildbot that's busted in some way

Given that this problem hasn't shown up until the new vlan existed and has only happened on the new slaves it seems likely that it's option #2 or #3. We should do a buildbot version comparison on a few new slaves vs old to look at that possibility and rope in IT to look at the vlan config.",major

With bug 173825 a message folder size column was introduced to the folder pane.
Depending on the size of each folder it shows kb or MB. In that other bug
there is no obvious reason why a lowercase b is used for the unit Bytes. So
I think this was an accidental slip and it should be changed to KB.

Four reasons why I think this should be changed:
- It looks odd (see screenshot I'll attach)
- It is the same unit so why use different case?
- b is often used for bits not bytes but from the source I see here it
means bytes
- From lxr I see Mozilla always uses KB for kilobytes (e.g. in the message
pane where the user sees it simultaneously which is even more confusing...) so
it should be used here also for consistency.

(The uppercase K (used everywhere else) should be ok here because it stands
for a factor 1024 (as usual): there is a distinction (that at least some make)
between K for 1024 and (defined by the metric system) k for 1000.)

Although this bug is visible at the front end I chose the back end component
because the affected code seems to be pretty far inside mail. Feel free to
change if I'm wrong...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open mail window with some big (> 1 MB) and some small (< 1 MB) message
folders visible
2. Make sure the Size column is shown in the folder pane (the left one)

have to reimplement the string code.  The idea is to have these clients link in
the string code so that they can have a snapshot of our string implementation.
 This allows the freedom to change the string classes in mozilla without worring
about backwards compatibly (assuming that no interfaces changes - string
interfaces are (or will be) frozen right!).  Basically the clients get a copy

Upon arriving on http://www.ffgurus.net/ I clicked on the Final Fantasy VII 
section which the URL is http://www.ffgurus.net/ff7/
when transfered to that page parts of the center and the entire white side were 
white. The status bar said done but the page is supposed to be in black.

The same thing occured on two other sections of that same website. The section 
URL's are http://www.ffgurus.net/ff10/ and http://www.ffgurus.net/ff11/
I inserted the URL's one at a time into my AOL browser location bar and the 
problems did not occur. 

Other URL's which display this same problem are http://www.megadeth.com/ this 
is seen at the top right corner of the page and on 
http://www.stillmatic.com/main.html the white mark appears
next to a chain like scroll bar on the page. It seems none of the images except 
for the navigation and the sky done in flash appear on this site.

1. Goto http://www.ffgurus.net/
2. Click on the Final Fantasy VII wait for it to finish loading then hit the 
back arrow key section the Final Fantasy X section hit the back arrow key

back arrow key after it's finished downloading.

firefox (and other unamed browsers) incorrectly handles punycode encoded domain
names.   This allows attackers (namely phishers) to spoof urls of just about any
domain name including ssl certs. 

Proof of concept url:

http://www.shmoo.com/testing_punycode/

The links are directed at http://www.pypal.com/ which the punycode
handlers render as www.xn--pypal-4ve.com

The domain was just registered so the root servers may not have gotten it yet.
 Point your dns servers at '216.254.21.212' if you have problems. 

Here's what I think the bug is:

1.  firefox (and mozilla) should warn the user if punycode is in use at all
2.  You should consider validating the ssl cert with the non-decoded version of
the website

Just in case it's not clear an attack case could be an ebayer/phisher who
includes links to paypal in their auction. When the auction ends the buyer
clicks on the paypal link (which is a punycode/proxy to the real paypal) and
proceeds to steal all of their private green bits. 

I have not done any platform testing or tested any other versions of
mozilla/firefox/etc.  I assume this bug is cross-platform.

The proof of concept urls are hosted on a personal server and as such I'd like
to have a chance to bring them down before this bug becomes public.  Please
email me at ericj@shmoo.com before marking this bug public.  

/me goes and reads up on the mozilla bounty program.

We have developed an XPCOM Add-On which is being used by many of our customers
for some while now. Our component uses the “nsIXMLHttpRequest” object to upload a certain amount of data using POST method.

Since NS_XMLHTTPREQUEST_CONTRACTID has changed with Firefox 3 calls to do_CreateInstance were not working anymore with Gecko SDK 1.8 (our pointer was NULL and error the code was NS_ERROR_NO_INTERFACE).

So we upgraded to latest version (gecko sdk 1.9 built from the official firefox 3 source code). Everything seems ok since we are now able to instanciate successfully our object in Firefox 3.
Yet as soon as call OpenRequest method of that object we get an error.

Here is what the code looks like:

 nsCOMPtr pXMLHttpRequest = NULL
 ...
 pXMLHttpRequest = do_CreateInstance(NS_XMLHTTPREQUEST_CONTRACTID 

 ... (here we just check that rv is OK)

 const nsAString
 nsDependentCString	myUrl = nsDependentCString(url)
 const nsDependentCString
 rv = pXMLHttpRequest->OpenRequest(myPostString myUrl PR_FALSE emptyStr emptyStr)
 ...

We can compile and run this code but when we call OpenRequest() rv is set to 0xc1f30001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED) and we're not able anymore to send any data.
Yet the result of do_CreateInstance() looks OK and our url (char *) is correctly initialized (it is printed in a logfile a few lines earlier).

Moreover we made a simple test by calling Abort() method which returns with no error so we assume pXMLHttpRequest is a valid pointer.

This code was working with Firefox 2. Is it a regression ?

WEBTOOLS_GRAVEYARD-387680,"In the CmTrunk build logs for Camino on maya and cb-xserve01 I'm seeing:

cat: ../config/build_number: No such file or directory

during the Talkback build and symbol delivery.  The build ID in master.ini is set to -server on the maya builds (which are not using the prebuilt Talkback archive) and the symbols are not uploaded.  The build ID is set correctly on the cb-xserve01 builds (using the prebuilt Talkback archive) but the symbols are not uploaded for those either.

This bug also seems to affect any other trunk build that uses Tinderbox.  I checked Thunderbird on Mac and Linux and those build logs are filled with the same message.

config/build_number no longer exists on the trunk since bug 383167.  Tinderbox' post-mozilla.rel.pl was updated in that bug to be able to pick up the build ID.  However Talkback was never updated and is still looks for config/build_number.  The Talkback Makefile has this line:

FC_BUILD        = $(shell cat $(DEPTH)/config/build_number)

Either the Talkback Makefile should be updated to know where to get the build ID (and new prebuilt packages generated for everyone using them) or (perhaps easier) Tinderbox should be updated to pass the build ID in to Talkback whenever calling any of its Makefiles.  This looks like it would be a matter of adding FC_BUILD overrides on the make command line to:

add ssh-agent to start-msvc*.bat files

CVS interactions in MozillaBuild are easier if you run ssh-agent and then ssh-add your key to it but it would be even easier if ssh-agent was already running and you only had to run ssh-add.  One way to do this is to start ssh-agent before rxvt and then start rxvt as a client of ssh-agent.

one way I typically run the viewer to look at lots of files quickly is like

what this command line does is load the url's in the file top100.txt with a 
minimum 10 second delay (longer if the file takes longer than 15 seconds to 
load.)  this lets me scan many pages quickly without having to type in any urls 
or click any links.  to run through the top 100 quickly to verify no crashes or 
asserts I use -d 0.

what I see is if I set the delay to a very small number 0 or 1 it works fine.

BUGZILLA.MOZILLA.ORG-318020,"As far as I can tell security@mozilla.org is always mailed when a *new* bug is filed with the security group box checked. At least some of the time we're mailed when the group is UN-set but there are several times I know of that I have gone to a newly filed security bug and found that the security group checkmark has been removed but no mail is ever received.

This makes me wonder if there are times when the group is set on non-new bugs that I'm not getting mail for and of course not knowing when a bug goes public is itself a potentially bad thing.

Could this have something to do with UNCONFIRMED bugs? I don't know if this has always been true but the recent ones that have exhibited this problem were all UNCO bugs. Could the security@mozilla.org account be set not to be mailed on UNCO bugs?

This problem *might* be since the recent BMO upgrade I can't remember when I first started noticing this. It's possible it's been around longer and I only noticed recently now that a new member of the security group has started to help triage the incoming.",critical

Patch v1 for LDAP C SDK

This problem is seen in client programs that use SSL clientauth and that 
use different credentials (client certificates) on different connections 
to the same server during the same process lifetime.  It is also seen in 
programs that use clientauth on some connections to a server but not on 
other connections to the same server during the same process lifetime.  

This is seen most commonly is test clients that are trying to simulate
different users but it may also be seen in servers that are trying to 
replicate different data sets to a remote server with a different client
credential for each different data set.  

The problem is that after one connection has been established between 
the client and the server using some (or no) credential all subsequent
connections to the same server may use the same credential (or same absent
credential) even if the client has called ldapssl_enable_clientauth 
specifying different credentials to be used for each subsequent connection.

Here is an explanation.  SSL remembers (caches) information about 
previously established sessions with remote clients and servers and 
reuses that information from old sessions whenever possible to minimize the 
expensive computational overhead of establishing new sessions with each new
connection.  When a new connection is made if the server says Let's reuse
the session we last used then the most recent session from that socket's
cache will be used even if that previous session was established using 
different credentials than the client now wishes to use.

NSS's SSL client library supports the use of multiple separate named caches 
to allow the sessions associated with one set of credentials to be remembered 
separately from the sessions associated with other sets of credentials.  
So a client program that uses credentials for Alice with some sockets and 
uses credentials for Bob with other sockets can have separate caches for Alice and Bob.  If the connections for Alice are configured to use Alice's 
cache and Bob's connections use Bob's cache all confusion over different 
credentials can be eliminated.  

When a program (or thread) uses a socket for which it has not configured an explicitly named socket then NSS uses a default unnamed cache for that 
socket.  There is only one default unnamed cache.  If multiple threads
trying to act as separate users do not specify explicitly named caches for
their respective users' identities then the separate users will end up 
using a common set of credentials from the common cache resulting in 
confusion.  

It may be reasonable for all LDAP connections that do NOT use client auth 
to share a common cache because each connections that uses no client auth 
typically is (re)authenticated using some other method such as simple name
and password authentication.  But it is not reasonable for client auth 
connections to share a cache with connections that use no client auth.

That is the problem experienced with the LDAP C SDK.  The LDAP C SDK never 
explicitly names a cache to be used with any SSL socket so all SSL sockets
share the common unnamed cache with the resulting identity confusion.  

A named cache is implicitly created the first time its name is configured 
to be used by a socket.  Cache entries have a lifetime after which they 
expire.  When all the cache entries for a named cache have expired the 
cache disappears.  So it's very easy to use named caches.  You just give
the name to the SSL socket before doing the first handshake on that socket
and SSL does the rest.  

I have attempted to modify the LDAP C SDK to do that to configure each 
SSL socket that will be used with a client certificate to use a cache with 
the same name as the nickname of the cert to be used.  I have attached 
to this bug an untested patch that I believe will solve the problem.  

I would like one of the LDAP C SDK cognoscenti (you know who you are :) to 
test this patch and see if it does indeed satisfactorily solve the problem 
for them.",major

The increment algorithm in the validateLeafName() function in nsHelperAppDlg.js
(and the equivalent code in contentAreaUtils.js) does not work if the filename
does not contain a dot. This bug causes Firebird to hang if you save an
extension-less file to a folder that already contains a file of the same name.

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/src/nsHelperAppDlg.js.in#254

Any file which does not already have a number appended will fail this test:

  var parts = /.+-(\d+)(\..*)?$/.exec(aLocalFile.leafName)
  if (parts) { ...

And will fallback to the else case unfortunately without a dot in the filename
the replace will fail:

  aLocalFile.leafName.replace(/\./ -1$

This means the filename will never increment and thus the condition in the while
can never be met and so FB goes into an infinite loop.

- Cleared all the cache (also from ie just in case as i read somewhere that ie cache can also have an impact on startup)
- disable update check for all three things
- Tried to compact the data base by Vacuum command
and finally when things didnt go well I removed the profile fodler from Documents and settings (removed mozilla folder)
Even after doing all the things above i still have a very slow startup of firefox for the first time(after reboot) subsequent startups are fine (3-4)secs. I have also been experimenting with earlier releases beta 234 rc1 the problem started after beta 4 as far as i can remember.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Read
http://www.int-evry.fr/mci/user/procacci/netscape/en/mozilla-autoconfig-en.html
and set up a mission control server as described in
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206294
2. Launch thunderbird
3. Observe web server logs to see a hit
Actual Results:  
No hits to the mission control servers coming from thunderbird client

Expected Results:  
Thunderbird should contact the web server and download the configuration and
apply them (lock some settings etc.) like Mozilla or Firebird does. However it
looks like it doesn't do that.

When I compile thunderbird on Linux with just export MOZ_THUNDERBIRD=1
mk_add_options MOZ_THUNDERBIRD=1 set in the .mozconfig it actually works but of
course it's not thunderbird anymore.",major

If .item <= min-width and a parent element has the float attribute the
text-align of .item is broken. Defining text-align for the parent element fixes
it but this is illegitimate.
It happens with all versions of firefox (including deer park).

CALENDAR-241961,"On OS/2 you can only add one entry.

I tracked down the problem to icalfileset.c.

The problem is that after a write icalfileset truncates the file to the
returned size.

In the OS/2 case the returned size is smaller than the actual file because we
use 0x0A 0x0D line endings.

I tried to fix this by taking the Windows case (which should work) but the
chsize crashed for some reason (we're investigating this with the OS/2 team)

Mails with a Content-Transfer-Encoding of 8bit created by mozilla (latest 
version) will have an invalid signature on the recipients end because mozilla 
(smime component) does not convert the original content into 7bit/quoted 
printable PRIOR signing.

If the setting -> Edit->Preference->Mail & Newsgroups->Composition->For 
Messages that contain 8bit characters use 'quoted printable' MIME encoding

is activated - mails will have a valid signature.

If this setting is however deactivated (meaning you create 8bit mails) - 
signatures are invalid. (NOTE : You have to create a mail with 8bit characters 
i.e. german umlauts)

The signature is invalid because the quoted printable data will be verified - 
not the 8bit data - 8bit data cannot be signed - only 7bit data can be signed 
and verified.

This BUG has been verified on multiple platforms (WinXP Linux Suse 9.1 MAC 
OSX).

This BUG consists of TWO problems :

1. YOU MUST always reencode the message to 7bit/quoted printable PRIOR signing 
as stated in RFC 2633

3.1.3 Transfer Encoding for Signing Using multipart/signed

   If a multipart/signed entity is EVER to be transmitted over the
   standard Internet SMTP infrastructure or other transport that is
   constrained to 7-bit text it MUST have transfer encoding applied so
   that it is represented as 7-bit text. MIME entities that are 7-bit
   data already need no transfer encoding. Entities such as 8-bit text
   and binary data can be encoded with quoted-printable or base-64
   transfer encoding.

2. For verifying mails have to be ALWAYS encoded back to 7bit/quoted printable 
PRIOR verifying - theoretically - the mail within my sent folder (8bit signed) 
should be INVALID but it is not - because you do not canonicalize the data 
before verifying which is an RFC violation too.


SOLUTION :

IF the mail is 8bit reencode it to 7bit/quoted printable before you sign.
IF a signed mail is 8bit reencode it to 7bit/quoted printable before you 
verify.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Deactivated the setting -> Edit->Preference->Mail & 
Newsgroups->Composition->For Messages that contain 8bit characters use 'quoted 
printable' MIME encoding and sign an email with smime using 8bit characters (i.
e. german umlauts)

Actual Results:  
Invalid signature on recieving clients and (also mozilla or any other for that 
matter)

Expected Results:  
Reencode Message to quoted printable/7bit prior signing",major

If you have two nested DIVs both with borders. The inner DIV contains a P with 
sometext.  If you dynamically resize the outer DIV the inner DIV border is 
resized so that it overlaps its contents.




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Create an Outer DIV with width set and overflow hidden or auto.
2.  Create an Inner DIV with a border set.
3.  Insert into the Inner DIV a P with lots of text and white-space:nowrap or 
alternatively a P with a border and width set.
4.  Dyamically resize the outer DIV so that its width is less than the width of 
the P contained in the Inner DIV.



Actual Results:  
Inner DIV border overlaps child P text.

Presumably Inner DIV border should not change - as in IE.",minor

file menu. You can do this either by pressing ESC while the switcher is active
or by pressing ALT+TAB and ALT+SHIFT+TAB or by pressing lots of ALT+TABs.  [In 
contrast to bug 94175 which is Win95-only ] this also applies to Windows 98 
which will always show the switcher even on a very fast ALT+TAB.

After clearing private data the information may still remain in the .sqlite file although it can no longer be accessed by Firefox and SQLite.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you haven't cleared your data in a long time (a few weeks)
2. Close Firefox.
3. Back up your data in your profile folder.
4. Start Firefox and go to Tools > Clear Private Data.
5. Check all the boxes and press the Clear Private Data Now button.
6. Open a .sqlite file (cookies.sqlite for example) with a text editor.
Actual Results:  
The sqlite file is still the same size and except for some changes in the beginning it is identical. Personal data can can be easily read since it is in plain text.

Expected Results:  
No traces of the user's data should be left. If a user clears private data there must be a reason for doing so so it should not be so easily recoverable.

A solution could be to run VACUUM after the data is cleared.

If i use the tab key to navigate through the form-control [FILE INPUT]and hit 
the enter key to the corresponding control (whether it is disabled or not)  i 
get a file upload dialog box and am able to select anmd upload a file to show in 
the control.

steps to reproduce:
1. open the testcase via the above mentioned URL
2. tab to the first control - this is an enabled [file input] control.
3. hit the enter key 

what happens ? -- the file upload dialog box will appear. select a file and say 
open. the file selected will be uploaded in the enabled  control.

4. U will have to hit the key once or twice more -- so that the focus is removed 
from the enabled control.

what happens? --- the next control is the disabled  control. you 
will notice that there is no visible focus on this control. Hit the Enter key.

Again -- the file upload dialog box will appear. select a file and say open. the

There is apparently an internal default timeout in Thunderbird for IMAP
operations - after 60 seconds if any particular IMAP operation has not
completed Thunderbird simply drops the IMAP connection re-opens
another one and immediately issues the same command again. This is very
bad behaviour on numerous counts. I'm not sure if the particular timeout
encountered here is listed on this site but it might be:
   http://kb.mozillazine.org/Modify_Thunderbird_settings

For example one customer of ours is testing deleting large numbers of messages.
Thunderbird by default does a message Delete by actually *copying* the
message to the Trash folder then setting the \Delete flag on the
messages in the original folder (for example the INBOX). In doing this
it is issuing IMAP copy instructions on a large range of messages in a
single operation. The IMAP protocol does not allow for any
processing... response (mid-transaction) in this only OK NO or BAD upon completion/termination of the operation.

If these operations take more than 60 seconds to complete Thunderbird simply
gives up and issues the same command again over and over. As the server
may not even now at this point that the connection is dropped it may
actually have multiple simultaneous COPY or APPEND operations initiated.

Following is an example from a CommuniGate Pro log for a copy of messages to the mailbox INBOX/TestMailbox notice the 1-minute intervals:

10:53:53.76 5 IMAP-45600([192.168.5.2]) inp: 25 uid copy 5708:14166
INBOX/TestMailbox
10:54:56.24 5 IMAP-45609([192.168.5.2]) inp: 7 uid copy 5708:14166
INBOX/TestMailbox
10:56:00.09 5 IMAP-45610([192.168.5.2]) inp: 7 uid copy 5708:14166
INBOX/TestMailbox

There are probably a few recommended behavioural changes here:

1. IMAP has no timeouts defined at all in the protocol:
     http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html

It would probably be better/more correct to use timeouts only at the TCP
level and not at the IMAP application layer since there is no support in IMAP to notify either party (server/client) of timing.

2. If you really think that timeouts are needed the default ones should be
increased significantly (5 minutes or longer at a minimum). However logically there will always be some operation which could be issued which would exceed whatever timeout was set. IMAP COPY or APPEND operations can be very resource expensive and time consuming for obvious reasons. Modern mailboxes may be many GBs in size.

3. If a timeout is signaled the client should not simply issue the same
command again as it can only make server performance degrade in this scenario.

4. It might be better if Thunderbird performed a copy operation instead
on each message rather than on ranges of messages. This would increase
the number of transactions but would ensure that each operation was
acknowledged individually (and would allow Thunderbird to display to progression of messages being moved to the destination mailbox).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a very large mailbox - one in which performing an IMAP COPY or APPEND will take longer than 60 seconds on the server to complete.
2. Copy the messages in this mailbox to another mailbox (or alternately just use the Thunderbird Delete operation which by default copies the messages to the Trash mailbox).
3. In most cases the operation will never complete or Thunderbird will lock-up/freeze.
Actual Results:  
Operation never completes successfully and the command may be automatically repeated indefinitely by Thunderbird (thereby potentially greatly increasing the load on the IMAP server).

Expected Results:  
The IMAP COPY or APPEND should complete eventually.

This bug is probably related to many others I found in the database though none exactly laying out the underlying problem which is that the IMAP protocol does not provide for timeouts or mid-transaction dialog. Therefore these timeouts should probably be removed from Thunderbird. Here are some other bugs likely related:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=406929
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=327312
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=325063
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=390257


Another optimization that could be made in this area though with more discussion really needed because of the change in behaviour is that the Trash mailbox should really be a virtual mailbox listing all of those messages marked \Delete without actually having to perform an IMAP COPY operation to a real mailbox called Trash. This is highly inefficient as a default behaviour. (Note: some users may prefer to have an actual Trash mailbox as a storage space so this behaviour could be retained as an option.)

Mozilla doesn't launch helper applications if they are defined for executable
files in the latest builds (it was possible in older versions without problems).
I use an helper application to prevent an not very experienced user from
executing (and saving!) applications by setting an helper application for
executable files that simply displays a dialog you are not allowed to do this
adds the file to a logfile and kills it. Then I've setted editable to false
for this dangerous mime-types in mimeTypes.rdf. This successfully protected
this user from executing any malware so far. No this save dialog reduces the
security in this scenario since this user is now able to save the file to
somewhere and open it.

Another useful application area for helper applications for executable files
would be an script that automatically passes the file to an virus scanner and
then decides if this file gets saved to the download-directory or if the file
gets deleted.

I've found out that this is caused by an patch for fixing the following bug:

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68279

I completely agree that it's needed to block the automatich Execution of
executables from mozilla (disabling Use default action for this type of file)
but I don't agree that it's needed to make it impossible to set helper
applications for them. If you don't want to make it possible to set helper
applications for executables per default then I think there should be at least
an hidden setting to make it possible to enable this via user.js.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set an new helper application for application/octet-stream (for example
open with notepad.exe)
2. Add an .exe-file of your choice to an compose-mail window and choose Send
Later from the file menu
2. Go to your unsend messages open the unsend mail and doubleclick the

-------------------------------------------

Hi

(credit: Gynvael Coldwind // Vexillium with help from udevd and porneL
(I didn't know about  D))

OK Here is how it goes.

Firefox has a problem in handling 8bit BMP files.
The BMP format has a field in the BITMAPINFOHEADER named biClrUsed the
field says how many colors does the palette contain. If this field is 0
then 256 color pallet is used. When this field is not 0 the palette has
the given number of colors.

Now this is how it goes in Firefox:
1. Firefox allocates 256 * sizeof(RGB) for the palette
2. It copies the biClrUsed colors from the BMP file

Well what is missing is:
1a. memset(pallete 0 256 * sizeof(RGB)
The palette still contains old data from the heap.

Now we take a BMP file sized 256x1x8 with biClrUser = 0 and fill the
bitmap with gradient from 0 to 255:
00 01 02 03 04 05 ... and so on

When displayed the BMP file looks chaotic and in fact it contains the
palette copied to the screen.

Here is where HTML 5.0 comes in and . You can imagine the
rest... But I'll write it anyway. You can create a HTML/javascript that
copies the image from img to a canvas and then gets it data and for
example using a form posts it to some remote server.

This has been tested and it works. There is a PoC exploit in the bottom.

The harvested data contains mainly trash but there are also parts of
other websites parts of java scripts even parts of favorites. Well if
there are also cookies and passwords in heap then they are also reachable.

I've attached also the scripts and the leak.bmp bitmap.

This will be posted on bugtraq as soon as a fixed version of FireFox is
released.

Please check also Thunderbird for this issue (I didn't check).

Best regards
Looking forward to Your reply

Cannot open Firefox after downloading it. Removed and re-downloaded three times
and tried to open different ways (icon Windows Explorer Programs) but did not
open. I get the hourglass momentarily but it won't open.

I removed SP2 and Firefox opened/worked fine. Contacted Microsoft about SP2 and
they said to contact you.

This appears to be similar to Bug 273098 but when I went to link:
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=225894#c32) with possible fix it
referred to Monzilla and Shockwave. But according to Microsoft their impression
is a conflict which seems to me to be more basic than some unique fix on my
computer. This seems to me to be a fundamental problem warranting a fix in your
program? (Besides to be honest such a fix - which is only a 'try this?' may be
beyond my computer skills as it seemed complicated and I am afraid may mess up
my computer with no assurances it will work.) 

Is there a (simpler) fix known to work you can provide me with or is there a
fundamental fix in the program that you need to do?

Thanks.

CORE-38378,"First some background as provided to me by the ever-helpful attinasi:

CSSFrameConstructor::AttributeChanged is called. This is were the
restyling happens. First the content object is asked what the impact of
the change is (given an attribute and a value). It can indicate a
RECONSTRUCTION a REFRAME or a simple VISUAL change.

For RECONSTRUCT the entire document is torn down and rebuilt. Pretty
harsh.

For a REFRAME a new frame is created for the affected content and
normal frame-construction / style resolution takes place.

For a VISUAL change we ask the FrameManager to compute the style change
impact. This walks up the frames getting the style contexts from them
and re-resolves the style on each one. ReResolve style runs through all
of the style rules for the content and any pseudo-style associated with
it and sets the new style values. As it goes it checks if the style
context actually changes and if it does it appends the new context to a
list of changes. It also keeps track of the kinds of changes that are
made indicating if there needs to be a reflow a reframe or just a
repaint. Depending on the results of the resolutions we then either
reconstruct the frames issue a reflow or update (paint) the views.

(End of attinasi missive.)

So this means that the _best_ case scenario for an attribute change is that we
walk every frame in the document and reresolve the style on each one.  Then we
decide what to do with it and in the best case again we do nothing (or issue a
paint I guess).

As an example of why I really want to fix this behaviour scrolling a GFX
scrollbar sets the ``curpos'' attribute lots.  Like lots and lots.

So I hacked up a patch which I will attach below.  It keeps a list on each
style sheet of each attribute that actually appears in a selector and then
checks against that table when an attribute changes.  Only if that attribute can
affect style context do we do the re-resolve dance.

With this patch I spit out a - for each style reresolution that I manage to
skip and a + for each one that has to happen anyway (no attribute involved in
the reresolution or attribute that mattered).  I scrolled the checkin-rules
page down and then back up and got the following:

------------++++++++++--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------++++++----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------++++----------------------------------------------------------------------------++-

So damn.  It looks like we can win pretty huge here.

But of course it's not quite that easy.  I'm apparently causing not _quite_
enough action in the layout engine at times because some needed updates aren't
happening.  As an example while the document scrolls the scroll thumb doesn't
move.  And image rollovers as found on my old nemesis http://www.honda.com/ 
don't work.

Maybe I need to fire a paint at the minimum.  Maybe I'm blocking reresolutions
too aggressively and need to be more careful that I only block the ones that
are directly from the AttributeChanged notification and not from other paths
through that code.  I'm not sure yet but I wanted to throw this out for people
to poke at while I ponder.

(I think the patch will build but some files did get touched lightly when I
updated before the diff and there are some other -- unrelated I think --
changes in my layout tree.  No warranty express or implied.)",major

CORE-102204,"Emails from smfr:

One problem that I can see in the menu code is that keep a
ref to 'gDefaultRootMenu' around which just happens
to be the first menubar we create. However if that menubar
gets destroyed then we delete all its menu items (the
nsMenu code releases its MenuRefs) but we don't remove
those deleted MenuRefs from their parent menu bar In
addition it seems that the parent menu is not holding refs
to submenus (as you might expect).

So the garbage that I am seeing on 9 is related to the
        ::SetRootMenu(gDefaultRootMenu)
on a root menu whose submenus have been deleted but not
removed from their parent menubar. I verified this by
inserting a new dummy menu into this menu bar.

---

One thing I think we should definately fix is that the dtor for nsMenuX
should remove its menuRef from the parent menubar right now that doesn't
happen.

This is seen more often with non-jar builds (which smfr runs bless his heart)
since there appears to be a race condition with which menubar (hidden window or
nav window gets loaded first. It's all good if the hidden window loads first
but if the nav window does we get garbage as the menu is populated with bad

There are 16 possible column headers. By default Thunderbird displays 8 of them.

1. Threads
2. Starred
3. Attachments
4. Subject
5. Read
6. Sender
7. Junk Status
8. Date

The problem is that the column header information is wrong. For the default settings:

- The column count is reported to be 3 when it should be 8
- Only the following headers are reported: Subject Sender and Date. Note these are just the headers containing text. 

This is a serious problem because the column count is used to determine the row and column for the cell as a specified index.  Assistive technologies cannot determine which cells belong to each column and row. In particular Orca cannot speak the cells in a mail header row correctly because it cannot get the actual cells in a given row.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable assistive technologies on the desktop.
2. Start Thunderbird 3
3. Start at-poke and view the treetable containing the message headers. You will see that the column count is incorrect and the header list only contains headers with text.

On my Debian system I had the NetworkManager service running however my wired network interface was controlled manually (in my case the relevant entry in /etc/network/interfaces was iface eth1 inet static which prevents NetworkManager from managing that interface). Therefore when using the wired interface I had network access however NetworkManager reports no network devices present (the commandline program nm-tool yielded:


NetworkManager Tool

State: disconnected

print_devices(): didn't get a reply from NetworkManager.
There are no available network devices.
).

This caused Firefox 3 to startup in Offline mode which forced me to manually uncheck File->Work Offline at the beginning of each session.

As a workaround I now disable the NetworkManager service before starting Firefox (now nm-tool reports

NetworkManager Tool

get_nm_state(): didn't get a reply from NetworkManager.


NetworkManager appears not to be running (could not get its state).
).

If NetworkManager intends that it is accurately reporting the online status of the computer (does it? or does it intend to only report the state of the connections that it is managing?) then I suppose that NetworkManager has a bug.

However in any case Firefox should have a config option that the user can use to tell Firefox not to query NetworkManager upon startup. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install NetworkManager
2. Configure things so that NetworkManager does not control any of the active network interfaces (I believe you can do this by adding all of the active interfaces to /etc/network/interfaces providing each of them with at least one option other than auto or dhcp). nm-tool should report state disconnected as described above.
3. Start Firefox. Observe that File->Work Offline is checked.
Actual Results:  
File->Work Offline is checked

Expected Results:  
I would expect that if I start Firefox when I am online (able to access remote web pages) and File->Work Offline was not checked at the end of my previous session that File->Work Offline would not be checked upon startup

I have heard of other people having similar problems in slightly different circumstances (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/191889).

Since NetworkManager cannot currently be relied upon to accurately give the online status of the system I am requesting an option that tells tell Firefox not to query NetworkManager upon startup. I could not find such an option at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Category:Preferences.",major

When pasting an image from the system clipboard to a Composer window Composer correctly creates a new image file on disk for this.

However it saves by default in JPEG and with very low quality compression (esp. for line graphic images like charts) causing bad visual artifacts and making small text in the image impossible to see.

This is reproducible and happens every time regardless of what kind of an image is in the clipboard to be copied.

Workaround is to save each image manually to a file OUTSIDE Composer and then manually link each image from within composer (from the files created).

However this is very tedious and time-consuming when editing existing web pages and copying multiple images from other applications.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Copy an image of your choice to clipboard pref. of original quality (no previous compression) one with line graphics and some text in the image. A time series chart with a title and X & Y axis labels is a a good example
2. Paste the image from clipboard to a composer Edit window (Ctrl+V).

Actual Results:  
Compare the original image (clipboard) vs the one now in the Composer window. See how badly the jpeg compression destroys the image contents in the Compoöser copy.

Expected Results:  
1. User selectable Image format (JPEG/JFIFF PNG GIF etc) format and compression ratio (for JPEG and PNG at least) in the preferences.

2. Additionally by default the compression ratio for jpeg (if jpeg format is default) should be lower resulting in less image artifacts in the copy/pasted images.",minor

In the German localization the Add-Ons entry in the Extras menu can be accessed by pressing Alt-X (for the extras menu) & (Alt-)A for Add-ons.

This choice of an accelerator key is annoying for two reasons:
1. A doesn't activate the menu item if adblock is installed because of an duplicate shortcut.

2. More importantly in Thunderbird the Add-ons entry is mapped to D. So in Thunderbird you press Alt-X D to get the Add-ons list.


I'd suggest to change FF's German shortcuts:

- Use O or W for Download (currently mapped to D but the Download list has a shortcut of its own anyway)

- Use D for Add-ons (at least for consistency with Thunderbird)

While looking into other bugs I found some unreachable code in
ssl_DestroySID and ssl_LookupSID lib/ssl/sslnonce.c.

1. ssl_DestroySID: In this function sid->references must be 0. Code
inspection shows that if |sid| is in the client cache the client
cache will own a reference. This implies |sid| cannot be in the
client cache. So sid->cached == in_client_cache will never be true.
I replaced the check with an assertion.

2. ssl_LookupSID: The function asserts sid->references >= 1 so the
two !sid->references tests will always be false.

Perhaps in the past NSS used to leave orphaned (reference count 0)
sid's in the client cache and clean them up later.",trivial

my notes about what I did and what happened

So I pushed a bunch of changesets to the try server (push-to-try) to figure out which of the 10 changesets that I landed caused the startup test to fail on Mac.  I got 11 builds as described in bug 479260 and 8 talos runs happened that were labeled with the changesets that supposedly generated the builds they were testing.

However the results don't actually make sense so I think it's pretty clear that the label that shows up in the tinderbox waterfall showing which try server build was tested isn't actually the build that was tested.

Attached is the text file describing what I did.  I pushed 10 changesets one-at-a-time and then later pushed 3 changesets (all at once) that were equivalent (but with different dates) to the first three of the 10.  The pattern of orange and green didn't make sense although it could have indicated that the problem causing the startup failure was random but happened most of the time.  (However I have at least 9 runs on the mozilla-central tinderbox saying it happens every time or pretty close to that.)

So on the assumption that it was random but happened most of the time I relanded the changes that were on later than the first orange plus two uninitialized variable fixes that wouldn't cause orange and the mozilla-central tinderbox turned orange again.

(Sorry if that's not clear I can explain in more detail if you really need it.)

So I conclude that the try server was lying to me about which builds it was testing.",blocker

Gostaria que fosse tema de análise a questão dos preços reais de bilhetes de
avião e os preços publicitados dos mesmos especialmente agora que a TAP vai
alterar o sistema de comissões aos operadores turisticos para aumentar as
famosas e indefinidas Taxas! Já é tempo da pouca vergonha das Taxas»

When starting with a new profile Mozilla imports IE Favorites.  If one of the
entries in Favorites is a directory entry (such as C:\) or a network entry (such
as \\nova\files) it recurses down through these to create bookmarks for
everything below there.  This can take an incredibly long time.

didn't see anything that addressed this specific problem.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Shut down Mozilla.
2. Remove or rename your profile directory.

we don't cache pop connections so I wonder want is going on there.  
we might have a dns cache in netwerk (to save calls to gethostbyname()) but I'm

it might be necko silently failing to establish the connection or us dropping

In most cases I got directly a 301 after requesting a page secured by basic
authentication. I have been relocated to something like
www.example-domain.com/secure_area/ (from: www.example-domain.com/secure_area -
the slash was missing). Firefox sent a new request which was followed by a 407
from my proxy server. My proxy server offered me ntlm authentication and basic
authentication. Firefox chose ntlm and authenticated transparently. After that I
got a 401 - the webserver only offered basic authentication. Therefore Firefox
chose basic authentication. I entered the correct username and password and a
popup occured telling me to authenticate against my proxy server.

The first problem was that Firefox chose to use basic authentication to
authenticate against the proxy server because it had used it before to
authenticate against the webserver. I've made a change in
nsHttpChannel::GetCredentials that avoids that this selection is performed for
proxy authentication.
I think this change does not break anything because we can only use one proxy
(that requires authentication) anyways and it should not hurt anyone when we
choose the first authentication scheme that we support to authenticate against a
proxy server - just as in all the other requests.
After I had changed this behaviour it worked when requesting
www.example-domain.com/secure_area/ directly (not when requesting
www.example-domain.com/secure_area).

The second problem was that Firefox automatically sent the ntlm type 3 message
when requesting the secured page with basic credentials. It seems as it simply
takes it from the last request. Therefore I added a little check to
nsHttpChannel::ProccessAuthentication to ensure that this message would not be
sent before it has been requested. The ntlm authentication starts again and
everything works fine now.

I'm not very familiar with the mozilla code but I hope that this patch
nevertheless fits into the design of the mozilla code.

I know about https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211843 but because of
the date of the last message and because I'm posting a potential patch I thought
it would be no mistake to create a new bug report. In this bug report a similar
- but not identical - situation is described.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup proxy server (I use squid) offering ntlm and basic authentication.
2. Browse website that requires basic authentication.

Actual Results:  
A popup will occur telling you to authenticate against your proxy server
although you have authenticated already using the ntlm authentication method.

After entering correct username and password for the basic authentication on the
requested website the secured content should appear.",major

The attached sample page shows and hides a region by setting its CSS
display property to block or none. If the accessible tree is
traversed after a change from block to none Firefox under Linux
crashes. The attached javascript shell log shows the required steps.

The talkback report for this problem is 31019831.

On Windows with the exact same Minefield build (2007-04-08)
the problem does not occur in this simple case. I will attach a
comment for how to provoke a similar crash on Windows.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See the attached javascript shell log
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
The accessible tree should reflect the changes to the display
property and Firefox should not crash when the accessible tree is
traversed. 

Some information about the traversal of the accessibel tree:

The code used can be found in:

http://firemacs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/firefox/moz.js

The relevant functions are dumpAccessibleTree and
dumpAccessibleNode.

The first function will simply traverse the accessible tree
recursively calling the second fuction for each node.
dumpAccessibleNode will access finalRole name finalValue state extState and
description for each node. These accesses sometimes throw an
exception which does not make much sense to me. For provoking the
crash it is apparently important to actually access these node
properties i.e. if the line calling dumpAccessibleNode is commented
out in dumpAccessibleTre no crash occurs. In other words simply
walking the tree structure is not enough for a crash.",critical

I used the windowsupdate.com site to install a number of non-critical updates
(most of them for hardware such as WLAN card modem mouse touchpad etc.)
and I was prompted to restart the computer.  After the restart Firefox wouldn't start.  Each attempt at starting Firefox would lead the firefox.exe process to terminate almost immediately *without* causing a crash.  So unfortunately there are no talkback IDs to report.  Check out bug #355594 which is a similar problem on the same machine and at the same time happening with Thunderbird as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to start Firefox.
2. Watch nothing happening (because the process is silently terminating.)
3. Start Firefox in Safe Mode.
4. Disable the Talkback extension.
5. Close Firefox.
6. Start Firefox in normal mode.
7. Watch the browser open fine.
8. Enable the Talkback extension.
9. Restart Firefox.
10. Watch nothing happening (like before.)

I could go on and on with the same procedure.

otherwise which makes them impossible to resize (downward) past a certain

under 1024x768 (in Mozilla and probably in most/all other browsers) and would be
too wide for probably any os/browser under 800x600 or smaller.  The end result
is that users are either forced to resize the window (if they can) or to
side-scroll annoyedly.


Pages should NEVER be given a fixed width intentionally unless extensive
platform and monitor mode detection takes place and a custom version of the page
is provided based on that data.  Care should be taken to prevent accidental
fixture of the window width at an unnecessarily wide point e.g. by overly-wide

A wrapper div contentarea contains a float.  A clearing element in contentarea
after the float brings back the document flow so content area actually contains
the float.  The float is several printed pages worth of content.  When print
previewing (shrink to fit for this senario others settings have the same
effect) and/or printing a bottom border on the contentarea displays at the
bottom of page 1 when really its contents go to page 7.  Content that comes
after the float in the document flow will start at page 2 overlaying the floats
content.  See the testcase attached and do a print preview.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. view testcase
2. do print preview or print the page out
3. see where the bottom border shows up at the end of page 1

Expected Results:

The quoted sentence ends with a preposition which is incorrect grammar.  I also

clear the old event and it's target:
    nsIDOMEvent* domEvent = nsnull
    if (NS_EVENT_FLAG_INIT & aFlags) {
        aDOMEvent = 

Eventually as the event bubbles up it is retargeted but never to the correct
original target.

If we call HandleDOMEvent without the NS_EVENT_FLAG_INIT everything works - but
I'm not sure what side effects that has with freeing memory.

I just started noticing that Mozilla's startup time has doubled since previous
night builds in July or before. Might have to due to the fact that page layout
loading time also increased greatly along with other things in Fizzilla.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Mozilla in OSX 10.1.5
2.Time it
3.Compare to earlier build in early July or before.

Actual Results:  Startup time has doubled.

Expected Results:  Startup time to be less or at least returned to previous
speed as in earlier july builds or before that.

I discovered this fiddling around with some of the form filling extensions. The form field length is reported as unknown by the extension. I typed in some nonsence then copy / pasted for about a minute. No end of field. I'm guessing it's 65000 in the database but the webpage itself needs a sanity check. Personally I can't see more than 1000 ever being necessary perhaps 500. Anyway currently a user could hose the page loading by submitting an insanely long comment. Note I didn't actually submit a comment like that so if there is a sanity check post form submit I apologize for the bug report in the first place.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click any extension 'add your own comment' link
2. Fill in the form with trash over and over
3. Click Post if you want to REALLY annoy the moderators. )

Actual Results:  
Not tested but hung page load or rediculously long page

Expected Results:

Build Identifier: Problem is in every build since 0.8 which works fine (Tried it with the final 0.9 and now with the latest 1.0pre) Thunderbird is 2.0.0.21 and with the 1.0pre I'm using 3.0b2

Ok

I'm in no means a developper and prob can't tell you all the right things but this bug is preventing us from moving from Lightning 0.8 to 0.9 so I need to file this bug.

We are using atm 0.8 version of the thunderbird plugin in our company. It works fine with our Sun Calendar Server (6.3 patch rel 121657-30). When upgrading to 0.9 and with the latest 1.0pre we encountere a following problem:

When creating a new event and inviting people to attend to it no invitations are sent. When checking the event from the calendar server it doesn't show it as being done by you but as you would have invited yourself to the meeting.

When opening the event again in lightning and closing it you are promted for saving changes even if no chages are done.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start creating a new event
2.Select people to invite
3.Save the event
Actual Results:  
You appear to invite yourself instead of making your own event and inviting others.

Expected Results:  
You create a new event for yourself and invite others.

I did trace the difference in the query sent by thunderbird to the sun calendar server and one major thing is different. When it is working in 0.8 we are sending this value: orgCalid	userid@domain.fi
and when it is not working in 0.9 and 1.0 pre we are sending only this value:
orgEmail	mailto:userid@domain.fi
Otherwise the sent packages look quite the same. There is some timezone info that is different but I assume that it has nothing to do with this.

So to me it looks like lightning is a bit unsure who I am and acts like I'm only some random inviter instead of beeing me.

Making events where no one is invited work just fine in 1.0pre so it only goes wrong when you invite people.

The only file I can find using that orcalId is this:calWcapCalendarItems.js
There are differences with the code between 0.8 and 1.0pre (Quite obvius).

I'm hoping that some one can figure out what's going wrong",major

CORE-300030,"This bug describes a design change that I've been talking about for a
while (see various posts to mozilla-layout).  Many bugs likely to be
fixed by this change have [reflow-refactor] in the Status Whiteboard.
I've been working on the changes on various REFLOW_{YYYYMMDD}_BRANCH
branches.

The basic idea to make two closely related changes at the same time:
 1. Change intrinsic width computation so that it happens in separate
    methods on nsIFrame.  (Currently preferred with calculation using
    the nsIFrame API can happen in two different ways as well:  having
    only one codepath reduces incremental layout ({inc}) bugs.)
 2. Change the way we handle incremental layout to use dirty bits on the
    frames rather than the reflow tree (which is essentially out-of-line
    dirty bits) and a complicated system of reflow reasons that often
    leads to weird incremental layout ({inc}) bugs.

I hope to add more details of the new design here in the near future.
Much of it is still open to change at this point the branch is close to
compiling and probably a ways from working so the cost of changing
things is still relatively low.",major

Since one of the latest Lightning updates (I think it was 1.3) I noticed that alarm popups very often appear to late. With Lightning 1.4 the new now indicator (the red bar) was new so now I see why the alarms appeared too late: the time that Lightning keeps internally often lags behind the real time.

A specialty of my setup may be that I am using it on a Laptop that I frequently suspend. After waking up I see that the software clock of the system is correct while it takes Lightning at least a few minutes (sometimes half an hour) to notice that it was wrong. Just now I woke the laptop up in the morning the system time clock showed 09:22:32 (Wed 23 May 2012) but Lightning's red line was at ~22:45 on Wed 23 May.

While I am typing this I set up a test event at 09:42 with an alarm 0 minutes before. It is now 09:46:00 and the alarm still hasn't shown up and the red indicator is still a bit above the alarm.

FIREFOX-489258,"Description of the Problem: Firefox window doesn't maintain docked position when minimized and restored.

Detailed Steps to Reproduce the Problem:  

1.	Install Windows 7
2.	Install Firefox from www.firefox.com
3.	Launch Firefox
4.	Dock it to the right of the screen using mouse 
5.	Minimize Firefox (using the minimize button or Winkey + M)
6.	Restore Firefox by clicking on the icon in the Superbar
7.	Actual Result - Firefox is restored to its location before it was docked to the right of the screen

Note:  This behavior is not consistent with other Internet Browsers: Internet Explorer.

Tester/Developer Notes: 

Firefox was installed on a machine and launched.  The size of the window of Firefox was adjusted using the WinKey +M and then re-sized using the icon on the Superbar however Firefox did not resume it original position on the screen.

Al's Note: I don't see the Superbar (just gadgets) in the public build of Windows 7 so I was unable to verify this bug. Marking this for 1.9.1 by default but we should find out what version of Firefox was used and if we can get access to a more current Windows 7 build.",major

When opening a bookmark folder in tabs unused blank tabs are not removed as
intended when tabs are loaded in the background
(browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInBackground = true). For example if three blank
tabs are opened by selecting New Tab from the File menu three times and a
folder of two bookmarks is opened the third unused tab should be removed
regardless of the value of the loadBookmarksInBackground.

I believe the problem is due to a misplaced line in
bookmarks.js::openGroupBookmark():

653       // focus the first tab if prefs say to
654       if (!loadInBackground || doReplace) {
655         // Select the first tab in the group.
656         var tabs = browser.mTabContainer.childNodes
657         browser.selectedTab = tabs[index0]
658       }
659 
660       // Close any remaining open tabs that are left over.
661       // (Always skipped when we append tabs)
662       for (var i = tabCount-1 i >= index --i)
663         browser.removeTab(tabs[i])
664 

The variable tabs should be declared outside the if (!loadInBackground ||
doReplace) statement so that it can still be used in the subsequent call to
browser.removeTab() when loading tabs in background and doReplace is false.

ADDONS.MOZILLA.ORG_GRAVEYARD-374109,"Currently we have several people flagged as editors who are reviewing on the preview site (which will become real AMO) but we have not established a review policy for Remora.

I suspect that currently editors are treating Push to Public as approve and Retain in Sandbox as deny. In other words unless there is something wrong with an add-on it is getting pushed to public which is not how the system was designed to be used.

Also all reviews (the comment kind) are moderated by default but editors have been given no instructions as to what kind of reviews should be approved (users will assume they are the same as in v2).

I think we need to stop all reviews until this policy is established otherwise we will be treating add-ons submitted after the policy is created unfairly.

If I do this from a slow link (like my ricochet modem which is ~28.8K) the UI
behaves reasonably (ie the throbber and status bar continue to spin XUL menus
continue to work etc).  Alternately if I sleep a while between callbacks (a la

Doug I took your advice and moved 99% of the callback logic to the LDAP

In the attached test case an SVG image is contained within a frame with an explicitly-specified frame border. When the image initially renders a spurious horizontal line is present. Scrolling the image causes it to become covered in horizontal lines.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached test.html
2. Click the button Click Me.
3. A popup window appears with two frames in which frame1 contains another Click Me button. click this.
4. An SVG image appears in frame 2.
5. Scroll the image up and down.
Actual Results:  
After step 4 the SVG image has a spurious horizontal line.
After step 5 the SVG image is covered in horizontal lines.


Expected Results:  
The SVG should not have any horizontal lines on it.

Essential to the test case are

(i) Use of a popup window (OK if frameset.html is loaded directly)
(ii) Use of an explicitly-specified frame border (OK with default border)
(iii) Loading the SVG in frame 2 from an on-click event in frame 1 (OK if loaded by specifying src=frame2.html in the frameset).

I've noticed a problem when a compiled Mozilla 1.6 on Solaris can crash on
Solaris machines even if they have the recommended Solaris patches in
'Installation Instructions for Mozilla Ports' page at
http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla1.6/installation-ports.html
I am compiling Mozilla on Solaris 8 with the latest recommended patch cluster
and the following addtional patches...
108434-14  108435-14  108773-18  109147-27  111697-04  111721-04

The machines the build crashes have at least the minimum patch revisions on the
Mozilla web page but they don't seem to be enough. I have a suspicion that patch
111721-04 (Solaris 8) and 111722-04 (Solaris 9) for Math Library could be the
culprit as they include support for new data types for which Solaris machines
without that patch would'nt be able to support.

I can't exactly say which patch is definitly causing the problem as when Mozilla
started to crash for me i had it fully deployed in my department and i updated
the patch revisions for Solaris 8 and 9 to their latest versions and sent them
out to all machines to stop people screaming at me

I think the web page detailing the Solaris recommended patches will have to be
updated and possibly the list of patches in the patch checker in Bug ID: 230598
which has just been checked into the 1.7 branch.

This problem came up in the discussion for Bug ID: 230598 and Roland Mainz
(roland.mainz@nrubsig.org) asked if he could be assigned this bug as he is the
person who did the list of recommended patches for Solaris and will look into
this patch problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile Mozilla on Solaris machine with latest C++ linker and math libraries.
2. Try running Mozilla on a Solaris machine without those patches.

NSS-422859,"This bug was originally reported by Kai Engert in bug 406755 comment 37.

He reports that he called CERT_PKIXVerifyCert passing it a set of one or
more certificates to be used as explicit trust anchors and a policy OID
and a cert from a particular server.

He expected the function call to either 
a) succeed and return a chain that was anchored by one of the roots he 
supplied or 
b) fail
Instead he reports that it succeeded but the root CA cert that it returned
as being the matching trust anchor was NOT one of the certs he had passed 
in to the call but rather was one of NSS's built-in trusted root certs.

So it appears that NSS did not use the caller-supplied list of anchors 
to the exclusion of all the other usual trust anchors but merely in 
addition to the usual trust anchors.  

This is bad news for EV.  

I think we should try to reproduce this with vfychain or vfyserv.  
I will attempt to attach to this bug a zip file containing the certs 
sent by the server in the TLS handshake.  

I don't know exactly how many root CA certs Kai passed to CERT_PKIXVerifyCert
but I believe that one of them was the cert found at 
http://crt.comodoca.com/COMODOCertificationAuthority.crt
and the EV policy OID used with it was 1.3.6.1.4.1.6449.1.2.1.5.1

Kai can you tell us if there were any other certs passed as trust anchors?",major

At line 4589 the condition is obviously erroned (and will always be true) and
should be

- if (s)
+ if (*s)

The write-in-memory at line 4592 is safe (in worst scenario it's overwriting the
terminating null byte by a new null byte) but the sscanf at line 4593 isn't : s
+ 1 could be out of bound of the buffer potentially disclosing a part of the

it's the right things to do.

Probably because of #define DH_MAX_P_BITS 1024 any client SSL/TSL handshake
that requires an ephemeral DH key generation will fail with error
SEC_ERROR_KEYGEN_FAIL (-8092).

By some estimates the strength of 1024 bit DH corresponds to 80 bit symmetrical
encryption. It is reasonable for the server to offer stronger DH in ciphersuites
such as TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA. 

Client such as Thunderbird 0.7.3 will select any DHE ciphersuite just to fail
later.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
# On the same host where you run Thunderbird do the following:

   openssl dhparam -out dhparam-2048 2048

# create file server.pem with proper content
# run the following: 

   openssl s_server -debug -accept 1993 -cipher EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA 

# Change IMAP server settings in Thunderbird to the localhost:1993 secure IMAP.
# Click on any IMAP folder such as Inbox.   
# The Thunderbird will display certificate warnings and hang.
# openssl will wait after displaying ACCEPT line.
# This is a normal behaviour everything is setup for the test


Actual Results:  
# now exit the openssl and run it again with the following addition: 

   openssl s_server -debug -accept 1993 \
      -cipher EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA -dhparam dhparam-2048

# Click on the IMAP folder in Thunderbird again. 
# This time the Thunderbird will display error -8092


Expected Results:  
The NSS should support at least 2048 bit DH key generation consistent with the
strength of other algirithms it implements.

The fix is probably as easy as changing 
   #define DH_MAX_P_BITS 1024 
to 2048. 

If not something else must be done to improve interoperability with correct
IMAPs/POPs (HTTPs too?) servers that are broken because of this issue

NSS seems the be the easiest place to fix this problem. Other workarounds
include scaling back support by the NSS client of stronger ciphersuites such as
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA to allow servers to limit 2048 EDH to these
ciphersuites.

the world can have l10n problems.

this was tested on moz 0.9.8 but it's my understanding that it exists in later
builds too: some languages (hebrew arabic and others) are written right to
left so the command 

windowdialogwizardpage {
direction: rtl
 }

needs to be added to the file intl.css in the folder locale/ab-CD/global in the
language pack ab-CD.jar file (ab-CD replaced with the language and country codes
of course). this causes the interface to be aligned to the right when the pack
is activated. 

problem: columns content like the columns in the mail/news client or the
address book or the bookmarks manager remaine aligned to the left with their
content positioned as if the UI is still aligned to the left with only the
column headers aligned to the right. e.g.: in the mail client the subject
header is at the right but the subject column is at the left.

expected result: columns should flip order and be aligned to the right like the
headers.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the file en-US.jar in the chrome folder
2. extract the file intl.css
3. edit the file as described
4. add the file back to en-US.jar (while maintaining folder structure)

Actual Results:

date etc.) is not. the same with other components mentioned above.

Mozilla loads Usenet group indexfiles (.msf) to memory when browsing group.
Naturally memory load increases amount of how large index is. Unfortunately
Mozilla 'forgets' to unload group indexfile when moving to next group that
results huge memory consumption especially when reading large groups.

In worst case one group indexfile takes ~10MB of diskspace resulting 100MB
memory usage after reading 10 groups. Memory usage returns to normal level only
after *ALL* mozilla windows have been closed. 

As you can see in screenshot mozilla takes ~120MB of memory and ~120MB of VM
after ~10 groups none of them are binarygroups. This bug leads to severe
overall system performance slowdown even on high-end machines and could crash
low-end systems.

NSS-183146,"In netscape.public.mozilla.crypto pingzhenyu@ideabank.net.cn reported 
an apparent bug in NSC_EncryptUpdate.  The code now reads (near line 757)

    /* encrypt the current padded data */
    rv = (*context->update)(context->cipherInfopEncryptedPart 
    
    if (rv != SECSuccess) return CKR_DEVICE_ERROR
    pEncryptedPart += padoutlen
    maxout -= padoutlen

pingzhenyu suggests that the third argument to context->update should be
&padoutlen rather than &outlen since the value of padoutlen not outlen
is subsequently added to pEncryptedPart and subtracted from maxout.

But in looking at this code further I think this problem is only the tip
of the iceberg.  The block of code that begins near line 740 with the test

    /* do padding */
    if (context->doPad) {

which handles saving of partial blocks from one update call to the next
clearly needs to be done for ALL block ciphers.  But it is presently being
done only for those block cipher mechanisms that feature PKCS#7 padding.  

For example context->doPad is set to TRUE for CKM_DES_CBC_PAD but not
for CKM_DES_CBC yet the handling of partial blocks is needed for both.

I think softoken has been getting away with this because the higher layers
tend not to do encryption updates with partial blocks.  SSL/TLS for example
does its own padding for partial blocks and so always calls update with 
full blocks.  Perhaps the PKCS#7 (SMIME) code behaves similarly.  But the
token's behavior appears to be wrong for partial block updates on block 
ciphers.",major

There is a certain class of PDF files that is triggering a very very serious
issue in Mozilla (can also repo in NS 7).   This class of files (of which the
test file above is just one example) often issue a byte range request very quickly
after the document opens.  (The above example is a file that opens with
Thumbnails ... to get the thumbnails Acrobat turns around an issues a pretty
quick byte ranges request ... just an example.)

In these circumstances  a very very terrible thing happens:

1 - Acrobat tells Mozilla to issue the byte range requests.  Mozilla complies
(can see the requests in a Windump log ... which I will put in the attachements). 

2 - The server downloads the requested ranges (which I can also see in the
windump log).

3 - Mozilla does not give us all of the ranges  (I can see this because
I am logging all of the calls to NPP_Write ... saving the offset and length
of the data.)

4 - Because Acrobat requested the data already and it needs it
it will hang (and hang mozilla) for five minutes until it times
out ... and then usually gives an error depending on what feature
it was waiting for data for.

YIKES!    
Unfortunately this is a very very serious issue. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Acrobat 5
2. Go to the above URL in mozilla

Actual Results:  
3. HANG in acrobat and mozilla ... wait five minutes or kill the apps


Expected Results:  
Displayed the PDF file.

Two attachments:

1 - The windump log showing the HTTP conversation
2 - My dump of what our Acrobat plug-in NPPDF32.dll gets
passed via NPP_Write  (you can do something similar on your end
or I can give you my test plug-in to try ... just let me know).",blocker

CORE-76198,"SUMMARY

The threadpool optimistically kills worker threads as soon as the total number 
of threads is greater than the minimun limit.  

The file transport uses the thread pool for its worker threads.  During startup 
there is an exceptional ammount of file transport activity.  For every file that 
is loaded in there must exist a worker thread in the threadpool.  The file 
transport sets min and max number for the number of threads.  The current logic 
in the threadpool is that it will spawn new thread for all requests up to the 
limit. When the worker thread when finished will check to see if there are any 
pending requests.  If there are none and there are more threads in the 
threadpool than the set lower limit the thread immeditely exits.  

Because of this algorithm there is alot of turnover in that pool.  The file 
transport could just raise the lower limit so that there are more persistant 
threads however this would just add to bloat since these extra thread are 
primarly needed for startup.

Another better solution would be to include a delay so that we can catch any 
additional request that may come in.  

For example:

From a normal startup to ftp://ftp.netscape.com.org there are 73 new threads 
created and 72 threads deleted.  (This is completely insane) After putting a 5 
second wait there are only 13 new threads created and 12 deleted.  This removes 
60 thread creation/deletions.  

Going to http://www.mozilla.org creates 49 threads.  Adding a 5 second delay 
reduces this to creating only 6 threads.

Clearly there should be some period of wait time before the thread exist so 
that we don't get a huge number of thread exits followed by an immeditate start.

I am not sure exactly what this will trim off of startup time.  I ran some basic 
timing tests.  On a P3 dual 500 (windows 2k 128mb ram) it take only 2ms to 
create 10 threads. However this is not a accurate picture since creation of a 
thread doesn't really do much but schedules it.  I also looked at how long it 
takes from the creation of a thread to its actual running.  The data indicates 
that it takes longer as there are more threads.  With 3 threads present it 
takes on average 200 milliseconds from the time PR_CreateThread() is called to 
the time the user defined function is entered and does a printf().  Maybe 
somebody here has better knowledge of thread startup preformance.

If I create frames with the DOM API calls and append them to a Frameset they
are not visible.  There are different forms of this problem depending on whether
the file is saved as .html or .xhtml. In a .html file I can cause the frames to
display content if I .setAttribute(cols**) after I append the new frames.
In .xhtml this doesn't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a frameset using a tag including an onload=doLoad(this)
2. In the doLoad() create two frames and set the src attributes to good URLs.
3. load the page

Actual Results:  
The window remains empty.

Expected Results:  
I expect to see the contents of the URLs displayed in the frames.

This is really just a step toward what I really want to do and that is to set
the location of the contentWindow properties of the frames with javascript.  No
matter what happens in the above example I don't get a contentWindow object. 
This I find this to be fairly serious because it has the potential for wasting a
lot of time on the part of a developer who wants to do things this way.  It
should work or be documented that it doesn't.

My web server happens to serve files ending in .xml as text/xml and xhtml may
be served as xml (although that is not recommended).  Deer Park Alpha 2 decides
to parse text/xml documents with an XHTML doctype as XHTML but display it as
XML and in the process unrolls some internal XML into the document.  The end
result is that my document which is not in any way covered by the MPL/GPL/LGPL
is shown as an XML parse tree /with an MPL/GPL block that isn't supposed to be
there/.

It is technically allowable to treat my xml-served XHTML as plain old style-less
XML.  However if that is the case it should not be combined with internal GPL'd
documents.  Alternatively it could be displayed and rendered properly as XHTML
which would be preferable but is not at all required.

See http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/#text-xml .

Representing a non-GPL'd document as a GPL'd document is a potential legal
liability so this really ought to be fixed altough it doesn't come up much in
practice.

Hi

I think this bug will only concerns the french localization of Camino because. In the seach bar (top right corner) theire is a possibility of searching in Le Jargon FR.

Unfortunatly Le Jargon FR have changed its URL. It was http://www.linux-france.org/prj/jargonf/ and it moved to http://jargonf.discu.org/ .

In order to allow searchin in the new website the search code sould be changed from:
http://www.linux-france.org/prj/jargonf/general/cherche.php?req=
to
http://jargonf.discu.org/index.php/Special:Search?search=

Fortunatly the new website works with Wikimedia so it should looks like Wikipedia search.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select Le Jargon FR in search bar
2.Search someting
3.Compare with http://jargonf.discu.org",minor

INFRASTRUCTURE_&_OPERATIONS_GRAVEYARD-496182,"* Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2009-032
 * Project: Webform (third-party module)
 * Versions: 5.x 6.x
 * Date: 2009-June-03
 * Security risk: Moderately critical
 * Exploitable from: Remote
 * Vulnerability: Cross-site scripting

-------- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------

The Webform module provides a node type which is typically used to enable
site visitors to fill in questionnaires contact or request/registration
forms surveys polls or other forms on a Drupal site. When displaying the
results of Webform submissions the module does not properly filter user
entered data leading to a cross-site scripting [1] (XSS) vulnerability on
sites with a specific configuration of input formats that would normally be
safe. Such an attack carried out against a sufficiently privileged user may
lead a malicious user to gain administrator access to the site.
-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED ---------------------------------------------------

 * Versions of Webform for Drupal 5.x prior to 5.x-2.7
 * Versions of Webform for Drupal 6.x prior to 6.x-2.7

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Webform
module there is nothing you need to do.
-------- SOLUTION ------------------------------------------------------------

Install the latest version:
 * If you use Webform for Drupal 5.x upgrade to Webform 5.x-2.7 [2].
 * If you use Webform for Drupal 6.x upgrade to Webform 6.x-2.7 [3].
This affects SFx and QMO


See also the Webform project page [4].

In DOM inspector Tab Object > Object - DOM Node we have nodeName and
nodeValue as column headers but IMHO nodeName is quite confusing.  I think
Node Attribute Attribute or Attribute name are more appropriate but by
nodeName I would think of the DOM property nodeName which gives the name of
element.

Similarly Attribute Value or Value are more appropriate than nodeValue.

CORE-186953,"Right now the maxElementSize member variable of nsHTMLReflowMetrics is an
nsSize with a width and a height.  We fill in the height using roughly the same
algorithm as the width.  The width has a useful purpose:  it's the smallest the
width of an element can go without overflow or at least it's supposed to be. 
The height has no such useful meaning: it doesn't even take into account such
basic characteristics of flow layouts such as forced line breaks.

Fortunately nobody uses the height.  Well almost.  nsListBoxFrame does but I
could replace its use with a 6-line loop.

I'm attaching a large patch to convert the |nsSize* maxElementSize| to
|PRPackedBool mComputeMEW| (in the old code you requested computation of the MES
by making the pointer non-null) and |nscoord mMaxElementWidth|.

The only substantive changes are in nsListControlFrame and nsBoxToBlockAdaptor.
 I'm not sure yet that the nsBoxToBlockAdaptor changes are correct (and I'd also
like to look at the nsBoxFrame nsBoxLayoutState and ns{Image/Leaf}BoxFrame
changes a little more closely.

|Reflow|.)",major

the trunk and the latest release versions (1.0.4 and 1.7.8 respectively) on
both Mac OS X and Windows.  This bug is more obvious on Mac OS X since it places
a grippy on the bottom right corner.  The dialogs are only resizable when
dom.disable_window_open_feature.resizable is set to true when it is false they
behave as they should.

The above steps reproduce this bug using a dialog box spawned by Firefox.  I
will attach a testcase which uses a JavaScript alert() windnow.

I apologize if this bug was filed under the wrong component but it was unclear
whether it should be filed as a JavaScript bug a DOM bug or something else...",minor

FIREFOX-283680,"For app-update instead of downloading standard .xpis Firefox is attempting to
install via xpi-wrapped native installer (smaller size for one).

Running Firefox launches the installer puts entry in xpicleanup.dat to get rid
of the installer.exe eventually.

Scenario I:
----------
If you leave Firefox running the installer eventually gets to a point where it
asks you to click OK to shut down Firefox. If you click the OK button to shut it
down (comes up twice see bug 283672) then Firefox shuts down apparently
without launching xpicleanup.exe

[On the side: the shutdown code attempts to pass the -kill option to shut down
turbo mode neither of which is supported by Firefox. A new browser window opens
instead which is a bit counter-productive if you're trying to shut it down.
Simply need to remove the turbo-killing lines from [Check Instance0] in config.ini]

At the end of the install the new Firefox is launched. It notices the entry in
xpicleanup.dat gives a shut down/restart message and launches xpicleanup.exe.

You should be able to restart Firefox now it's just a bit ugly getting here.

Scenario II:
------------
As above but instead of letting the installer kill Firefox shut it down
cleanly. xpicleanup.exe is launched to deal with the installer entry in
xpicleanup.dat but because the installer is still running it hangs around
trying every polling interval.

During the install it finds xpicleanup.exe is in use so another entry is made
in xpicleanup.dat to finish installing that when the install is over. I don't
think the installer launches another copy of xpicleanup.exe at the end though.

[At this point the xpi script should have returned a 999 status code to the
native installer because the xpicleanup.exe hangup means it couldn't complete
and the native installer should have put up a message about needing to restart
to complete the install. Not seeing that in Firefox.]

At the end you launch Firefox which gives the incomplete install message
because xpicleanup.dat exists. It launches another copy of xpicleanup.exe. The
installer goes away so that part of the cleanup can be accomplished but
xpicleanup can't delete itself so it just hangs around never able to finish. At
this point it should have put a startup entry in the windows registry--if you
reboot everything gets straightened out but if you keep starting Firefox you
just get the message and more copies of xpicleanup.exe all waiting for each
other to die.

Scenario II is uglier than Scenario I.",major

CORE-150604,"From Bugzilla Helper:
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible MSIE 6.0 Windows NT 5.0)
BuildID:    2002053012

Mozilla ignores the stale flag from WWW-Authenticate Response Header.

Stale is a flag indicating that the previous request from the client was
rejected because the nonce value was stale. 
If stale is TRUE (case-insensitive) 
the client may wish to simply retry the request
with a new encrypted response without reprompting the user for 
a new username and password.
(RFC2617)
But Mozilla reprompts the user in this case as well as 
when stale is FALSE or absent.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the digest authentication scheme on server
   (the implementation must response on incorrect nonce and set stale
    flag in WWW-Authenticate in this case). I use proxy server Oops
    with my modules to test.
2. After changing nonce-value on server side server responses on request based 
on stale nonce with 401 error (WWW-Authenticate with stale=TRUE)

Actual Results:  Client should simply retry the request
with a new encrypted response without reprompting the user for a
new username and password.

Expected Results:  Mozilla reprompts user for new credentials.",major

If a select form field is resized to 1 using javascript then resized to >1 it
does not expand the select box size correctly (it still behaves as a pull-down).

On the other hand if the select form field is resized to 5 using javascript
first it expands the select box correctly (and it while thereafter regardless
of being resized to 1 later).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the test URL.
2. Click on the link to set the size of the select box to 1
3. Click on the link to set the size of the select box to 5.
4. Take note of the actual size of the text box.

With the most recent Trunk builds - using 2006051020 (1.2+) - the browser fails to connect to websites after it has been idle for a moment. It shows 'loading' in the statusbar but the site is never loaded.

Other symptoms observed: clicking on a link does nothing anymore.

This has happened in two ways:
load page then go reading your email  back to browser and it is dead
load page let it sit there while I was looking at another browser on another computer.

Trying to view any SVG with the cairo backend will CRASH mozilla on Solaris.

X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
  Major opcode of failed request:  72 (X_PutImage)

After some googling I found this: 
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/cairo/2004-January/000956.html

I changed cairo_xlib_surface.c to say 
  image->depth == 32 ? 24 : image->depth
instead of 
  image->depth

And this solved the crashing. I'm not creating a patch because everything that's
supposed to be red is now green here (and the other way around)... :). These
colors can probably be fixed by doing a bitshift but I'm really uncertain about
where to do this and IF this is the right way to proceed.

This issue is a CAIRO vs (24 bpp) XFree issue so it should ideally be solved by
the cairo team...

NSPR-454878,"We tracked down bug 454587 to as far as we can tell PR_GetPhysicalMemorySize returning 0 every so often.  When this happens we end up creating a 0-size memory cache (as well as not creating the right size for some of the Places caches during startup etc).  The problem happens particularly often if PR_GetPhysicalMemorySize is called twice within a short period of time (which is what happens during startup) but it seems to be happening in some other cases too (which causes the test failure in question).

The relevant (Mac-specific) code is:

302     struct host_basic_info hInfo
303     mach_msg_type_number_t count
304 
305     int result = host_info(mach_host_self()
306                            HOST_BASIC_INFO
307                            (host_info_t) &hInfo
308                            
309     if (result == KERN_SUCCESS)
310         bytes = hInfo.memory_size

and it looks like things fail when |result| is not KERN_SUCCESS.  In fact in my tests it's often 5 (which is the generic KERN_FAILURE value).

Requesting blocking since this has some pretty serious performance implications: we end up creating memory caches that are completely the wrong size in various places.

Not sure who we have around who'd be able to do something with this... shaver any ideas for a Mac guru?",major

The security warning for opening exes borrowed from IE6 SP2 should be reverted to the Firefox 2 for various reasons:

- Depends on Windows version (XP Vista / no SP SP1 SP2) and IE version. A browser should not depend on another one!
- Can not be disabled from the warning box itself in contrast to the Firefox 2 warning. (The check box in the IE box only disables it for one file)
- The only way to disable it is in the IE settings Dialog box! Changing settings for Firefox using the IE settings dialog box is completely ironic and not user friendly.
- People who uninstalled IE with a program such as XPLite (Like me) are not able to change the setting! Uninstalling IE is not a too rare thing among Mozilla fans.

Please reconsider the warning box or implement it in a way which is less dependent on IE.

MOZILLA_LOCALIZATIONS-395648,"An ein paar Stellen der Übersetzung wird von Diskette/Festplatte im Sinne von Datenträger gesprochen. Ich habe darüber mit Abdulkadir in der Vergangenheit bereits diskutiert ob man das abändern soll. Wir haben es letztlich immer vor uns her geschoben da wir nicht über eine aktuellere Begrifflichkeit einig wurden.

Ich persönlich finde schlichtweg Datenträger gut. Abdulkadir meinte aber dass dies nicht für jeden DAU verständlich sei. In Zeiten von USB-Sticks Flash-Cards CDs DVDs etc. sollte man IMHO aber nicht mehr nur von Diskette/Festplatte sprechen. Theoretisch wäre sogar ein Datenträger im Netzwerk LAN/WAN möglich als Zeil zum Speichern von irgendwas.

matter) with the same subject both of them show up in the certificate manager
dialog under personal certificates. However only one is available in Mail &

Both are valid certificates. If I only import one of them I am able to sign a
mail with it.

Since certificates in the NewsGroup Account Settings\Security\Digital
signing\certificate select combo are postfixed by the serial number I would
still be able to select the right one if both were shown but as it is now if I
import two different certificates with the same CA only the first one I imported
is shown.

I think this happens more often than one should think because the subject is
often a persons full name and a person can have certificates from different CAs.

CORE-123049,"Not sure exactly who to give this to so I'm cc'ing some layout heavy-hitters
and assigning it to myself ...

This bug was originally reported as bug 117141 (Composer crashes when loading
pages with an HTML Select element [@FrameManager::GetPrimaryFrameFor]) for
which I checked in a work around.

The basic problem is that nsStyleChangeList::AppendChange() does not deal
with the fact that anonymous frames can point to either an anonymous content
node or the content node for a parent frame.

Should two or more sibling anonymous content frames require a frame change
we can get into trouble if we push an anonymous content node on the changelist
and then push the parent content node on the list as the result of a
sibling frame who's content pointer pointed to the parent content node.

nsCSSFrameConstructor::ProcessRestyledFrames() processes the changelist
backwards which means it would process the parent content node first so
as a result we end up blowing away the entire frame hierarchy including
the anonymous content frames and all their anonymous content. Leaving
deleted nodes in the change list that will be processed.

When they do get processed we usually crash some place like
GetPrimaryFrameFor().

I'll attatch a JS test case that demostrates this crash rather easily
in the browser and viewer. It's probably a good idea to read over
the comments dbaron and I made in bug 117141 for more details.

A stack trace for the crash looks something like this:

Would you upgrade CCK  thanks 


------------SA-2008-069 - CCK FOR 5.X AND 6.X - XSS VULNERABILITIES------------

 * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-2008-069

 * Project: Content Construction Kit (third-party module)

 * Versions: 5.x 6.x

 * Date: 2008-November-5

 * Security risk: Minor

 * Exploitable from: Remote

 * Vulnerability: Cross site scripting

------------DESCRIPTION------------

The Content Construction Kit (CCK) allows certain privileged users to add
custom fields to content types using a web browser.

Some field labels and content-type names are displayed without appropriate
filtering in the administrative interface. Malicious users with the administer
content permission are able to exploit this issue and insert arbitrary HTML and
script code into pages. Such a cross site scripting attack (XSS) may lead to the
malicious user gaining full administrative access.

This is only an issue if you need any role separation between administrators
and users with the administer content permission.

------------VERSIONS AFFECTED------------

 * CCK for Drupal 5.x prior to 5.x-1.10

 * CCK for Drupal 6.x prior to 6.x-2.0 (including all RC releases)

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed CCK module
there is nothing you need to do.

------------SOLUTION------------

Install the latest version:

 * For Drupal 5.x install CCK 5.x-1.10 [ http://drupal.org/node/330570 ]

 * For Drupal 6.x install CCK 6.x-2.0 [ http://drupal.org/node/330573 ]

See also the CCK project page [ http://drupal.org/project/cck ].

------------REPORTED BY------------

The cross site scripting issue was reported by CCK maintainers.",critical

CALENDAR-400407,"Testing the Sunbird Update (betatest channel) 0.5 -> 0.7 reveals a problem for the Swedish Win32 version. Restarting SB after the Update fails withe an Error Message. Neither different L10n versions nor platforms seem to be affected.

The problem can as well be reproduced by forcing the update locally w. previously downloaded *.mar files. Both *.mar file types seem affected the partials as well as the complete *.mar file.

Steps To Reproduce (STR):
=========================

1. download and install Sunbird 0.5 sv_SE installer.exe
2. edit Program Files/Mozilla Sunbird/defaults/pref/channel_prefs.js and 
3. change 
pref(app.update.channel release)

pref(app.update.channel betatest)
4. launch SB and trigger Update

Actual Result:

CORE-76209,"Another fallout of profiling the colour table stress case (the style people must 
begin to hate me. :-) ) is that there is a nsVoidArray that is emptied one 
element at a time which causes alot of memmoves which degrades performance when 
pulling down a big style system.

If I understand it correctly StyleContextImpl's destructor 
calls StyleSetImpl::RemoveStyleContext which removes the style from a cache with 
the following code.

  nsVoidArray *pResults = nsnull
  if (NS_SUCCEEDED(GetContexts(aKey&pResults)) && pResults) {
     PRUint32 nCountBefore = Count()
     if (nCountBefore > 0){
       if(pResults->RemoveElement(aContext)) {
...

RemoveElement is slow since it requires moving at average half the array in 
memory. When done with all elements we get a nice O(n^2) algorithm.

0.5 seconds when leaving the colour table stress case.",minor

If we flash an sdcard with the old kernel (before this commit) then we can put that sdcard into any panda and that panda will boot. However with the new kernel about 50% of the pandas we try with the new kernel will not boot.

Expect commands for calendar files to be in the File menu but some are hidden
in the Tools menu.  Suggest collecting them into the file menu.

The 'new calendar' command does double duty as 'open calendar' command but this
can be confusing (at least on windows platform) because it uses the file picker
in 'save' mode which warns about overwriting an existing file even when trying
to open that file.  Therefore suggest separating New and Open functions so that
the Open function can use the file picker in open mode rather than save
mode.  Previous discussion:

I receive a could not create proxy folder error when attempting to import 
folders that contain non-alphanumeric characters (#/etc).  The cause appears 
to be the inability to create the temporary folders required during import for 
these folders due to restrictions on the Windows operating system for folder 
names.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create folder in Outlook with / or # sign (or any sign not allowed by the 
Win32 filesystem)
2. Attempt to import Outlook folders from Mozilla
3. Observe proxy error.

Actual Results:  Error displayed.

Expected Results:  Import should have succeeded.

Since Mozilla stores folders as files files cannot contain symbols restricted 
by the Win32 filesystem.  This may or may not be an advantage for the mailer 
though it may affect folders that use irregular symbols.

A workaround is to rename the folders to remove these characters before 
importing.",minor

pkg.m4 builds up LIBS compile variables from --libs-only-L and --libs-only-l so
as to avoid possible mishaps such as getting -Wl--export-dynamic. This approach
is too conservative as it means that it also gets rid of necessary flags such
as -Wl-R/some/path. The patch I will attach once I find the right place on this
web front end takes the opposite approach: if you don't want
-Wl--export-dynamic then remove it.

The actually problem came about when xpidl wouldn't run so it was impossible to
compile firefox. The reason was that xpidl couldn't find libIDL-2.so was because
the necessary -Wl-R/usr/local/lib in

% pkg-config --libs libIDL-2.0
-Wl-R/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lIDL-2 -lglib-2.0 -lintl

When I open several tabs often four the tab border located in the center
disappears.  It stays gone even when tabs are switched just displaying a slight
bump in the center.  This is hard to describe.  I have also seen it work on
Windows 98 Mozilla 1.01 (I believe).  Often with more than four or five tabs
(enought o overflow the screen making the tabs shrink to less than their
defautl size) it makes more than one intratab border disappear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Mozilla
2.Press control-T several times until there are enough tabs that they have to
be shrunk.
3.Observe the borders between the tabs.  If none of the borders have
disappeared open a few more tabs until you see it.

Actual Results:  
One (or more) of the intratab borders disappeared into the primidorial grey.

Expected Results:  
All the tabs should have been separated from each other by crisp borders.

An image is embedded in a page using OBJECT using valid (X)HTML. The image
appears in the normal page view. If you right click and select Page Info -->
Media you do not get the image displayed. You get a generic icon. Other people
have reported the same result using Firebird/Fox. If the image is marked up
using IMG it is selectable and saveable from the Page Info --> Media tab.
The image has the proper MIME type associated with it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Embed an image using OBJECT
2. Right click on page containing OBJECT
3. Try and select/save the image in Page Info --> Media 

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. The image is not selectable/saveable

Expected Results:  
Displayed an image in the list of media types.",minor
CORE-232567,"Mozilla needs to remove all support for username and password authentication in
the URL from HTTP HTTPS and HTTP with SSL. This problematic feature allows
URLs in the form of:

http://username1:password2@example.com

Currently when Mozilla gets that URL it takes the user to example.com and logs
the user in as username1 with password2. Unfortunately this can be
exploited. Indeed it has grown increasingly common that URLs in the form of
http://username:password@example.com are creating large security problems. Take
this example:

http://www.mozilla.org&item%3Dq:20933773d88383h2nf8dhdfjk3jk377d7djk3354@example.com/bad/evil/fraud/identitytheft

Following that URL a user might think he is going to the friendly confines of
mozilla.org. Unfortunately he ends up at the unfriendly confines of
http://example.com/bad/evil/fraud/identitytheft. 

This feature is being used today to harm and exploit our users. We have to respond.

Mozilla has made improvements in our handling of these URLs. Further
improvements are on the drawing board. 

Neverthless any improvements ultimately cannot raise our level of security high
enough. We can try to fashion a dialog box or even highlight the URL in an eye
catching manner. User education must accompany any such enhancement of course.
The Internet will always have many new inexperienced and uneducated users.
Even experienced users sometimes click on the wrong URLs by accident. Therefore
it is inevitable that many Mozilla users will be exploited by this feature no
matter how we improve on it.

The only way to really solve the problem once and for all is to rip out URL
authentication altogether.

RFC 1738 may indeed require that an HTTP(S) implementation (like Mozilla) honor
URL authentication. 

http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1738.html

Allowing these kinds of URLs was fine a few years ago. Today however it
creates a security hole ever more commonly exploited. The Mozilla Project does
need to honor standards. Yet when the purpose of a certain standard is no
longer relevant or is outweighed by other concerns--such as security--then we
have to react to the changing real world conditions. Today the cost of
supporting this feature far outweighs the benefit. By removing this feature we
will fix a major security hole for good.

Microsoft has announced it will remove support for these URLs.

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb[LN]834489

Since MSIE currently has an 80%+ market share most sites that make use of this
feature will soon give it up. Thus when Mozilla follows suit and removes the
feature our userbase will not be terribly aggrieved.

Neither FTP nor any other protocol is affected by this bug report.",major

If calling AppendComment with an indefined $timestamp (e.g. AppendComment($bug$login_name$message)) the query is supposed to substitute function NOW() in the INSERT query.

Unfortunately now that the query is done with DBI and placeholders it appears that the function call is being bound as a string causing an incorrect zero timestamp to be stored instead of current time. This zero timestamp apart from being bogus means added comments are not displayed on bug pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. invoke AppendComment($bug$login_name$message)
2. in MySQL examine bug_when field in table longdescs in the newly inserted record.
Actual Results:  
timestamp will read 0000-00-00 00:00:00

Expected Results:  
timestamp should be time of INSERT (e.g. 2005-11-06 16:53:31)

My quick and dirty workaround is to use two different queries depending on whether timestamp is defined:

if($timestamp){
    $dbh->do(q{INSERT INTO longdescs
                      (bug_id who bug_when thetext isprivate work_time)

If a test case is associated to more than one component it will be returned multiple times when filtering by more than one of those components. For instance assume we have three components (C1 C3 and C3). Now let's assume we have a test run that includes the following test cases with their associated components in brackets...

TC1 (C1)
TC2 (C1 and C2)
TC3 (C3)
TC4 (C2 and C3)

In the test run search we choose to filter by component and select both C1 and C2 meaning we want all test cases that are associated to C1 and/or C2. We would therefore expect to get the following list returned...

TC1
TC2
TC4

Instead we get the following...

TC1
TC2
TC2
TC4

The second result is duplicated because it is associated to both components that have been queried (likely a missing DISTINCT in the sql). The test case count at the bottom becomes inaccurate because counts them separately. In our previous example it would say that there are 4 test cases that match our filtering criteria in the current test run when in truth there are only three.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Associate five different components to a test case
2. Create a test run that includes this test case
3. In the test run view expand the Filter section
4. Select three of the five components associated to the TC in Step 1 and click the Filter button.
Actual Results:  

The same test case run is listed three times and the test case count at the bottom of the table says 3 test cases found when in truth there's only one.

Expected Results:  

The test case run is listed only once. The count at the bottom says 1 test case found.

Note that clicking on the Case ID heading can be used as a temporary workaround due to bug 384212 (as long as you don't have a version where it's already fixed).",minor

When filling the View->Page Style menu Firefox thinks he doesn't have to show the entry default page style because there is a preferred stylesheet set (a stylesheet with title attribute).

Unfortunately the preferred stylesheet has media=handheld so it is not displayed in the menu and Firefox isn't displaying this the menu too.

RELEASE_ENGINEERING-461020,"When speculative script parsing (bug 364315) landed we started seeing intermittent orange on the Talos boxes due to crashes during Tp. Eventually I disabled speculative parsing so that the trees would be green for beta1. However it would be nice to re-enable speculative parsing.

The problem is that it isn't at all clear why the Talos boxes are crashing. As far as I know nobody reported any speculative parsing related crashes or was able to reproduce the crashiness. I did try to install standalone Talos however I was unable to reproduce the crash with the regular pageset and installing the full pageset into my standalone talos caused it to not work at all (as far as I could tell the browser refused to start at all becoming a defunct process immediately).

I was able to hack something up to run through the pageset but after ~40 cycles across 4 machines I crashed only once in seemingly unrelated code.

It would be really nice if I could get some sort of crash stack for the crashes that Talos is seeing so I could direct my debugging efforts directly at the problems that Talos is running into (instead of staring at the code trying to come up with any possible problem).

In the URL above a browser sniffer JavaScript writes a link to an appropriate
style sheet.  For Netscape/Mozilla this one:
http://espn.go.com/insertfiles/css/mlb/font_nn.css
Here is the W3C validation output for this style sheet:
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fespn.go.com%2Finsertfiles%2Fcss%2Fmlb%2Ffont_nn.css&warning=1&profile=css2
There are two parse errors:
* Line: 93
  Parse error - Unrecognized : }
* Line: 395 Context : .NEWSNFL
  Parse Error - .NEWSSUBNFL { font-family: times font-weight: bold font-size:
14px}
The second parse error turns out to be a missing right curly brace (}).
The two most important rules for the layout of this page (and all pages based on
this template) are .STATS and .SCHEDbold -- located below the 2nd parse error. 
When I make a local copy of the files (HTML and CSS) and correct the first error
on line 93 (removing the extra } ) Mozilla displays the page exactly the same
as it did before (incorrectly).  It is only when I fix the missing } error
(even if I don't fix the first) that the page displays correctly (that is
Mozilla applies the .STATS and .SCHEDbold rules).
The .STATS rule is the 3rd rule listed after the missing } and the .SCHEDbold
rule occurs a great deal below the missing }.  I think Mozilla ought to be
able to recover from this error after at most the next occurrence of a closing
brace (}).  In that case both the .STATS and .SCHEDbold rules would be
processed and applied to the page's layout making the best of a bad situation.
Both IE 6 and Netscape 4.79 display the local copy (and the online copy) of the
page correctly _before_ I correct either error.  In my local copy of the HTML I
hardcode the link to the style sheet so that the same one is used in any
browser.  The effect is still observable when I include the CSS file's contents
inline in a style tag (instead of using a link).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Load the URL in Mozilla
2.  Observe that default serif font and default size are used in the table
instead of the styles from rules .STATS and .SCHEDbold.

Actual Results:  Mozilla does not (is not able to?) apply the .STATS and
.SCHEDbold rules.  (No recovery from parse error prevents it?)

Expected Results:  Mozilla makes the best of bad CSS and recovers from the
missing curly brace error as soon as it can and salvaging subsequent rules
including .STATS and .SCHEDbold (both of which occur far enough below the
missing } error to be salvaged).",minor

It looks correct in my all-skins.rdf. I even jared up the skin directory in the
hopes i can get it to work.
No go.

We need more DEBUG printfs here.

resource:/chrome/theme_builder/theme_builder/content/
*** Chrome Registration of skin: Checking for contents.rdf at

Is not good enough.

How about some real paths here so i can debug this.

Also is there a way to print out the chrome registry from js or something? (Like
a for in loop)
As to the mappings of where it thinks everything actually is located?

Stuff like this would be timelessly useful.

If anyone has gotten a skin to register and work for an external package w/out
using the existing skins please let me know how you did this.

This is a problem when connecting to the Java applet for St. Bernard Software's iPrism. 

This applet works fine in Mozilla 1.7.13. It does not work in SeaMonkey and does not work in Firefox 2.0. Because this applet is broken in new versions of Mozilla products and works fine in older versions I can only speculate that there has been a change to the code that breaks this.

My guess as to what happened is that:
 * we called gtk_clipboard_request_contents with a stack address
 * wait_for_retrieval timed out
 * clipboard_contents_received was called later and then accessed a stack data structure that was no longer valid.  (I'd have expected valgrind to say it's an address in the stack segment beyond the stack top but apparently not...)

It seems like either:
 * the retrieval_context object should be heap-allocated in case wait_for_retrieval doesn't wait long enough
 * we should cancel the request for the contents (if possible although I don't see a way looking at the API)",major

Our mail server uses 251 responses when forwarding mail to external servers. 
Mozilla is fine with sending to one address resulting in a 251 response that's
at the END of the list of recipients.  If however you send to multiple
addresses with 251 responses or send with a 251 response before the end of the
list you get an error.

I've not looked a lot at the Mozilla source but I did find code that seems to
explain the problem.  In nsSmtpProtocol.cpp there's a state system used to walk
through sending a message with SMTP.  In this section of code in the
SendRecipientResponse method:

1162    if(m_responseCode != 250 && m_responseCode != 251)
1163     {
1164     nsresult rv = nsExplainErrorDetails(m_runningURL
NS_ERROR_SENDING_RCPT_COMMAND m_responseText.get())
1165     NS_ASSERTION(NS_SUCCEEDED(rv) failed to explain SMTP error)
1166 
1167     m_urlErrorState = NS_ERROR_BUT_DONT_SHOW_ALERT
1168     return(NS_ERROR_SENDING_RCPT_COMMAND)
1169     }
1170 
1171     if(m_addressesLeft > 0)
1172     {
1173         /* more senders to RCPT to 
1174          */
1175         m_nextState = SMTP_SEND_MAIL_RESPONSE 
1176         return(0)
1177     }
1178 

251's are accepted as they should be.  But in line 1175 the state is set back
to the mail from response state which would seem to go back to the
SendMailResopnse method with this piece of code:

1101   if(m_responseCode != 250 || CHECK_SIMULATED_ERROR(SIMULATED_SEND_ERROR_11))
1102     {
1103         nsresult rv = nsExplainErrorDetails(m_runningURL
NS_ERROR_SENDING_FROM_COMMAND m_responseText.get())
1104         NS_ASSERTION(NS_SUCCEEDED(rv) failed to explain SMTP error)
1105 
1106         m_urlErrorState = NS_ERROR_BUT_DONT_SHOW_ALERT
1107         return(NS_ERROR_SENDING_FROM_COMMAND)
1108     }

The 251 would then be rejected at this point as it's not a valid response for
the MAIL FROM command.

Two possible solutions:

1.  Don't use exact error numbers...just stick to the major classes like 2xy for
positive completion responses per RFC 821.

2.  Change m_ResponseCode back to 250 at line 1175.

Like I said though I don't know the Mozilla source so I'm pretty much just
guessing here that I'm looking at the right piece of code.

See comments from number 28 in bug 428843. This causes undesired side effects with an inaccurate message.

Following on from the above patch Firefox now prompts to save 'tabs' on exit even when none are open.

Apart from the message being inaccurate because no tabs are open this is an extremely frustrating annoyance.

When no tabs are open there should be no prompt. In the rare event that the user accidentally closes the browser they can always go to the most recent one in their history when they start.

As things now stand the user would either have to
1.) Put up with the prompt each and every time they close the browser.
2.) Disable the prompt and never get prompted even if they have multiple tabs open.
3.) disable the prompt but have the session restored every time thus bypassing their homepage.

I feel the patch for 428843 should therefore be backed out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure preference browser.tabs.warnOnClose = true
2. Open the browser.
3. Close the browser
Actual Results:  
You get an erroneous (and unnecessary) prompt.

As a result they serve the XSLT transformation sheet when Mozilla requests

The right thing to do would be serving the HTML file (accomplished by setting

doesn't make sense to serve the transformation file because the transformation
is not an alternate version of the document. It does not make sense to serve the

rendered in a useful way by a user agent that does not have a priori knowledge

BUGZILLA-452893,"Due to a very old bug in 2.20 and older (bug 365264) some flags have a modification date set to 0000-00-00. strptime() doesn't return undef and so DateTime tries to build an object with this invalid data crashing Bugzilla. To fix that we could either let checksetup.pl fix these dates e.g. by setting them to the creation date which is better than nothing or let sanitycheck.cgi find them and offers to fix them using the same workaround as above (maybe safer?) or let Util::format_time() detect the invalid date and return ''.

While testing data passed to format_time() it appears that strptime() sets the month to -1 for 0000-00-00 00:00:00. I have no idea if this is something official we can use or not to detect invalid dates but this could also be a way to fix the problem without altering the DB.

I'm glad it's not just me.  I've been seeing this for two or three days

issue.

The first page loads fine but when it's about time for the refresh the
browser crashes.  This happens for both a debug and an optimized build.

The crash does not cause a core dump so I can't get a backtrace.  My gdb
is also acting up (it's complaining about a ptrace failure when the first
thread splits off) so I can't run it under a debugger either.

I'm running MkLinux (a PPC-based Linux implementation) on a Mac 8500/150.

When I go to bugzilla to report a bug in either Firefox or Mozilla
search results window (defaulting to top 100 when window initially displayed) is squished under firefox+.  It's only enough to display 1-line summaries of 4 bugs and is about 4cm high.
Under Opera and IE the window displays 17 and 12 bugs respectively  and have vertical heights of about 21 and 22 cm respectively.  The DPI is set the same (101) in all three browsers.

This makes perusal of the buglist difficult and frankly dissuades me from looking at very many bugs for duplicates (maybe whatever is in the first 2-3 scrolls on each browser or about 8 bugs on FF.  

Why is this window so darn small on FF?  It's weird that FF can't display full bug-result window on its own bug-manager but Opera and IE can display full size windows of nearly same height.  Theoretically I believe FF's window should be of similar height -- since the screen size is constant on all and the dpi is constant on all -- so whether or not it computes a window height based on an absolute height (say 21.5cm high) or a percent of screen height or percent of window height (windows are all roughly same height -- slightly smaller than screen height) they should be in same ball park but FF's windows are about 1 fifth the height of the other two browsers. 

I can't imagine this problem is limited to FF but I don't do side-by-sides on every webpage.  This example is especially in my face because it's the main entry for entering FF and TB bugs.

Slightly tangential suggestion -- maybe FF needs to do a bug-fix and code-cleanup *only* release -- maybe a redesign of code structure toward more optimality (assuming anyone has thought of more optimal structures if not nevermind on that! :-)).  It's just that I notice in many projects that features keep getting added on and at some point due to the way the code has developed a different structure/organization works better (smaller faster cleaner more internal orthogonality/less overlap&duplication...etc). 

Only reason I side-comment is that sometimes bugs like this just fall out/disappear as a side effect of a code cleanup.  It may be the case that something in the code has systemically caused size problems due to a some programming model that doesn't quite fit the problem space.  The slightly odd fit might not have been a problem before but as a project expands a slight-misfit can grow into noticeable problem (a bit like a small pebble in a shoe feeling like a boulder after walking several miles).

small window gives portal sized view of ocean's worth of data

Expected Results:  
large window taking up large percentage of screen to allow me to view many bugs at one glance without having to scroll (since scrolling uses mouse and RSI problems make me mouse&typing conservative).

I believe this has been present since shift to 1.5 though for sure since 2.0.
Incorrect sizing of this window is a major problem on this page and I believe may be an expression of other size issues in the code where it doesn't scale output widgets in accordance with text scaling.  Though in this specific case the problem appears to be exacerbated well beyond what is commonly the effect of text-widget scaling inconsistencies.",minor

I have tried this with Bugzilla version 3.0.2 3.0.4 and 3.0.5 with
similar results.

The setup of our Bugzilla/Testopia is as follows:
- Bugzilla version 3.0.5 (just upgraded from 3.0.2)
- Testopia version 1.3 (Upgrade to 2.0 appears to somewhat function
despite the error)

Postgresql version:

# psql --version
psql (PostgreSQL) 8.3.1
contains support for command-line editing


It appears that when upgrading a postgresql setup of testopia it trys to
send MySql commands to the database which causes it to error out. Is it
not possible to upgrade Testopia when using postgres?



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
My method for upgrading Testopia is as follows:
# cd /var/www/virts/bugs
# patch -p0 -R -i testopia/patch-3.0
# wget testopia-2.0.tar.gz
# tar xzvf testopia-2.0.tar.gz
# patch -p0 -i testopia/patch-3.0
# ./checksetup.pl

When I ran patch -p0 -i testopia/patch-3.0.x at the end instead it did
not patch correctly and checksetup was halted earlier than this error.

I tried to code-inspect this away again and I think I see a way that this could
happen.  When an event queue is being popped
nsEventQueueServiceImpl::PopThreadEventQueue will:

1)  Call StopAcceptingEvents() on the queue
2)  Call ProcessPendingEvents() on the queue

Consider the case when processing one of these events causes a call to
revokeEvents on the thread on which we're popping the event queue.  The caller
will typically get the thread event queue and call revokeEvents on it.  The
thing is nsEventQueueServiceImpl::GetThreadEventQueue will get the youngest
queue that's still accepting events.  Since the queue being popped is no longer
accepting events an ancestor of it will get returned and hence events that
were posted to it will not get revoked.

Per blame we used to return just the youngest queue.  The change to returning
the youngest active one was made by darin in revision 1.34 of
nsEventQueueService the CVS comment is: freeze nsIChannel nsIRequest.  The
change doesn't seem to be part of the diffs in the relevant bug.

Darin do you know why you made this change?  Given that inactive queues forward
event posting to their ancestors it seems that it should be save to always
return the youngest event queue event if it's inactive for GetThreadEventQueue...",major

Under some circumstances doing a search on tripadvisor for a hotel for example scole inn and then clicking on the search result will crash camino.  The following error will appear in the console: camino[304] Mozilla has caught an Obj-C exception [NSRangeException: *** -[NSCFArray objectAtIndex:]: index (1) beyond bounds (1)]. I encountered this in normal browsing but it's easiest to reproduce a similar or same crash following steps below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start with clean profile following procedure in Camino FAQ or use troubleshoot camino
2.Set preference Open tabs instead of windows for links that would open new windows
3.Go to tripadvisor.com and search for scole inn and select first search result
4. Click Window and note presence of hidden popunder window. The presence of the popunder window seems needed to produce a crash.
5. Go to preferences and select Tab bar always stays visible.
Actual Results:  
On my system Camino will crash.

Expected Results:  
Tab Bar is displayed. I am not sure how Camino is supposed to handle the hidden window that is already there when you select always display tab bar or how Camino is expected to handle a popunder window if the open tabs instead of windows for links that would open new windows preference has been selected.

The tripadvisor site sets a cookie call CommercePopUnder and the presence of this cookie and value seems to have something to do with the crash. For example Camino will NOT crash if the cookie is present with the value SuppressAll.",critical

Back in the day of srcdir builds clean-config.sh was probably pretty handy: no need to even have a mozconfig findable just fire it off from $topsrcdir and it would remove all makefiles (that were produced by all-makefiles anyway) and configure output.

Now with srcdir support amounting to we won't automatically wontfix a bug just because it only happens with srcdir builds it probably doesn't see much if any use but it's still pointless to have it looking for a file which hasn't existed since bug 381902 landed two years ago as a sign that it needs to remove mailnews makefiles when mailnews doesn't exist in mozilla-central.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I registered at addons.mozilla.org
2. Before I received the activation e-mail I requested a reset password e-mail.
3. Tried to activate my account.

Actual Results:  
After I did so (see Steps to Reproduce) activation of the account fails (There was an error activating vaurynov@mit.edu). I am allowed to reset password but the password does not work (You were not successfully logged in. Check your e-mail address and password and try again.) I can not recreate the account either (The E-Mail address you entered is already in use.) So I could not find a way out of the circle.

Expected Results:  
If account was not activated yet and a user tries to request a reset password e-mail he/she must get an error message asking to activate the account before resetting password. 

Or (which would be even better) if an account is not activated yet and user requests a reset password e-mail he/she should get an activation e-mail instead.

It takes quite long time to receive *any* e-mail from you (either activation or reset password) after one follows the steps described above. I tried to reproduce the problem using an other e-mail address but after ~40 min of waiting for an e-mail from from you I decided just to send what I have now.",major

Several times Camino has crashed and then been un-bootable that is the program
tries to open and never finishes opening (splash screen never comes up even
though hard drive is ticking away). I'm not really technically savvy and the
only fix I have come up with is deleting everything in the cache (I haven't
found a way to purge the cache from within Camino). This last time there were
over 6000 items in the cache folder when it crashed. Once those items are
deleted Camino will start again.

nsHttpChannel class. It would be however nice to have especially for
embedding purposes.

IE has a similar working option (which is inadvertently set on true by default).

Implementing it would require some simple changes in the nsHttpChannel class (am
I wrong ?) that I would gladly make. The default setting
browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl = false is surely the right thing to do but some

Patch

var stream = create an empty storage stream somehow...
stream.getOutputStream(0).write(foo 3)
stream.getInputStream(3) // throws exception


The above code fails for a couple reasons: most obviously  and second the uninitialization of segment buffers when the storage stream contains 0 bytes (either with no writes or with an explicit 0 write) after the first condition is changed.

This patch fixes this so that you can get an input stream for a storage stream whenever the given position is less than or equal to the amount of data in the stream -- so long as data has been written explicitly even if the amount of data written was 0 bytes.  It does not allow a getOutputStream(0) immediately followed by a getInputStream(0) which I attempted to implement but finally abandoned as more trouble than it was worth and more than likely behavior the author would consider a bug.  (Note that there *is* a use case for writing 0 and then getting an inputstream from position 0 -- see the URL field.)",minor

This fix is required to avoid an error when creating an item where the calendar is not set on the item passed to adoptItem (i.e drag to create).

In Firefox the page text is rendered at the left edge of the page which
overlaps the red bar running down the left edge of the page making it hard to read.

In IE6 the red bar is still there but the text is shown indented a bit which
makes it easier to read.

Looking at the source of the page there might be an issue with tables and
perhaps the leftmargin attribute though that's just a guess.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit URL listed
2. Observe red bar long left hand edge
3. Observe text overlaid on top of the red bar instead of being indented

Actual Results:  
I saw that the text was rendered on top of a red bar along left hand edge of the
page making it difficult to read.

Mozilla creates a lot of threads (more than 50 is not uncommon)
and seems to never terminate them. I was able to generate 90 threads
in 30 minutes just by intensive browsing.

The problem exists in trunk builds (tried with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows
U WinNT4.0 en-US rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031015) and is inexistant in
1.5 branch builds.

The problem is evident while using HTTP proxy (Squid actually).
I didn't try to reproduce it with proxy disabled. It doesn't seem
to be connected with Java or Flash (i have Java disabled and the
pages that cause new threads to be created do not contain Flash
objects).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla
2. Start monitoring 'Thread count' in Windows Performance Monitor
3. Browse

Actual Results:  
Thread count grows endlessy while browsing (opening new pages) and stabilizes 
when the browser is idle displaying a page. I reached 90 threads in 30 minutes 
of intensive browsing and over 200 (with earlier trunk build) while browsing 
with browser window open for several days.

Expected Results:  
Thread count should fluctuate but not grow endlessy. Mozilla 1.5 tends to keep 
less than 20 threads open.",major

Actual Results:  
Got the above reproduced error message with that mistake in the translation.

Expected Results:  
A well translated error message )

...or even no error message at all! (see below suggestion in Additional Information)

Apart from fixing that small mistake maybe Firefox could be modified so if the user has a wrongly set TEMP/TMP variable (for example a non-existent X:\Temp) it falls back to a default C:\Temp or something like that instead of showing an error message which doesn't even clue about having a wrong TEMP variable (I discovered that was the source of the problem after some fiddling).

Or maybe it would be enough to warn the user about having a TEMP variable pointing to an inexistent disk instead of that generic File not found message which doesn't help much to find what's the problem.",trivial

CORE-14676,"FreeBSD 3.x has a bug in its implementation of dlopen().  If the same C++ symbol
is exported from multiple libraries opened with dlopen() every library picks up
the version of the symbol present in the *first* library opened with dlopen.
See  for details on this
FreeBSD bug.

This bug naturally wreaks havoc on Mozilla components both bug 6323 and bug
13154 seem to have been due to it though in each case it's been specifically
fixed (or perhaps worked around) by declaring offending symbols static.
However there is enough copy&pasted code in Mozilla that tracking down every
multiply-defined symbol seems an impossible task.  (I don't currently have any
specific behavioral bugs that can be tracked to this though now that these two
bugs have been fixed so QA can probably take a break on this one.)

The behavior of dlopen() has been changed in FreeBSD 4.0-CURRENT I think this
is why neither of the above two bugs were apparently present on 4.0-CURRENT
machines.

The correct workaround for this bug I think is to force Mozilla to be compiled
with --enable-low-fat on FreeBSD.  This flag strips all symbols except the four
that are required for components (and are opened with dlsym()) from the
component binaries.

Note that on FreeBSD versions prior to 3.3 (or 4.0-CURRENT) you'll want to
apply the fix described in bug 14241 to --enable-low-fat or dlopen() will spew
huge amounts of debugging information.",major

DIRECTORY-1984,"From: Schneider Stuart 

   Just wanted to pass along another update while trying to use PerLDAP on
an NT4 system.

   After I started converting some of my scripts from Net::LDAPapi to the
new modules I came across a problem where the new library would blow up and
return an Error: Runtime exception after performing between 200 to 5000
searches on the directory.  I've since installed a C compiler on my system
and have been seeing the exact same problem with v1.1 of the modules.  I've
managed to track the call down to the ldap_value_free call made at the
conclusion of the ldap_search_s XS function call.

   As a temporary fix I've commented out the call to ldap_value_free in the
API.xs file and my scripts now work perfectly (although I do notice a memory
leak when running the script - after about 20000 queries the script is
consuming an additional 5meg of memory).

   What additional information can I provide to help track this down?
Personally I'm leaning towards the possibility that this is a bug in
Netscape's LDAP library for the Win32 platform since the same code works
perfectly on my RedHat Linux system.  Unfortunately I have to run this on
Win-NT.

There are two problems :
1. The failure should not be ignored . Not having softokn3.chk generated means
that NSS applications such as Mozilla will not be able to enable FIPS mode a
feature wanted by the government. The fix for this is to remove the - from the
rule which causes the error to be ignored .
2. The signing script sign.cmd did not execute . It appears that because I'm
running under the 4OS2 shell the result is 'Unknown command d:' on my system
. This is the first time I run into any build problem related to 4OS2. I have a
fix which works regardless of the shell the user is in which is to invoke the
default OS/2 command interpreter cmd.exe directly to run the script.

I have attached a suggested patch to resolve these two problems which works fine
on my system. Please review and test it.",major

IAccessibleText::attributes returns the attribute run representing a mis-spelled word if you give it an offset which is the offset after that attribute run. i.e. its the endOffset of the attribute run.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In a new thunderbird message type This iss a test.
2. call IAccessibleText::attributes for that node of text giving it an offset of 0 to get the This  attribute run.
3. Give it an offset of 5 to get the iss  attribute run [the mis-spelling] 
4. Give it an offset of 8 the start of the final attribute run [after the mis-spelling].
5. Give it an offset of 9.
Actual Results:  
*Giving 0 gives back startOffset: 0 endOffset: 5 and the appropriate attributes.
*Giving 5 gives back startOffset: 5 endOffset:8 and the attributes for that run.
*Giving 8 gives back StartOffset: 5 endOffset: 8 and attributes for that run.
*Giving 9 gives back startOffset: 8 endOffset: 15 and the attributes for that run.

Expected Results:  
*Giving 8 should give back startOffset: 8 endOffset: 15.

It seems that this bug is only related to the attribute runs of mis-spellings. The tests I have done seem to show that other attribute runs for bold italic etc do not cause this problem. 
This issue is very important as it can cause any AT using IAccessibleText::attributes to possibly go in to an infinite loop as the relationship between the given offset and the resulting start and end offsets is not correct.",major

When running checksetup.pl during installation it reports that Chart::Base
0.99b must be installed.  If this direction is followed (as I did initially)
the time-based charts option will output a zero-length gif.  The install
documentation states that 0.99c is required I ended up installing the latest
currently available 2.2 and time-based charts now work correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. follow the requirements of checksetup.pl re installing Chart::Base 0.99b
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
time-based charts will output a zero-length gif

Expected Results:

The thunderbird is built from ubuntu source debs and with -g no-strip with all the patches that ubuntu ships. 

The servers being hit are two of my office servers tunnelled over ssh. One of them is a dovecot over SSL (9930). The other is a homebrew (in-house) IMAP server which runs over NFS off a NetApp filer with replication. That's the one that's causing the crash here.

In short the server is not to be trusted and could be sending bad input. But even then it should give an error gracefully not SEGV",critical

namespaces all to MDC?  I know we tried to change the namespaces before and it
caused all sorts of problems so before we try to do this again I'd like to
know that we've done a full investigation into what's required and how to avoid
the problems we encountered previously.

See testcase that I'm attaching.

Using this snippet in html:
check #c1
and this style:
input{display:none}
input:checked+label{background-color:green}
you can still check the checkbox and the label becomes green but unchecking the
checkbox (which works with display:none) the label stays green.

Checking/unchecking a checkbox to the left of the original does reresolve the
style in the right way.

1. Press button: toggle display radio/checkbox buttons -> inputs have display:none
2. check/uncheck the checkboxes

Actual Results:

The url shows what I mean and this only happens while I'm resizing an element or more specificly a div with a rounded border. The radius is being applied in a seperate css file and it's set to 20px. I have the most recent nightly build as would be indicated by the build identifier. I'm using an 8800gtx and q6600 so I can't see it being an issue of not being able to render fast enough.

If I'm mistaken on my methods of applying a rounded border expecting it to render fine while being re sized than I apologize.

To give perspective trying the same effect in safari it cheats and turns the border into a sharp edged border before finishing the rendering and turning it back into a rounded border and it is completely smooth however not exactly what I expect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a div and give it a border using -moz-border-radius: 20px
2.resize the div using timers (in order to see it clearly one second for each 200 px)
Actual Results:  
I see what is shown by the link I included under the URL field.

Expected Results:  
a straight outer border and clean rounded corners.

When an extension has contents.rdf files but no chrome.manifest chromereg makes one for it. It does this in parts writing out the conversion of each contents.rdf file separately appending to the manifest file each time. Only there's a bit of a problem with that... the file pointer is at the *start* of the file each time it re-opens it for appending.

http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/chrome/src/nsChromeRegistry.cpp&rev=1.346&mark=1559-1560#1549

I've verified that aAppend is true (value 1) but cannot easily verify the location of the file pointer except by observing the resulting changes in the file after each PR_Write.

The result is that each segment is written ontop of the other giving a completely messed up and broken manifest. Given the lack of code changes to the chromereg code in this area I'm going to guess it is an NSPR or XPCOM bug. The Unicode XPCOM I/O bug springs to mind but I've got no evidence either way.

I've set this to major because it looks like a low-level file handling issue which could potentially affect a lot of things and it completely breaks installing extensions in Firefox that have no chrome.manifest (which was exactly the thing I was testing).",major

The right column has three images each with text underneath much like a

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on an *image* in right column say the firefox logo on black
background above the other merchandise caption.


Actual Results:  
There is just one item a decal.  The other categories also appear to have just
one product.  Quite disappointing.  


Expected Results:  
Page listing other mechandise with several items.  Ditto for other categories.

Much later I clicked on another link and found that there are category listing
pages.  It turns out the problem is that in the right column the image links to
just the representative product pictured rather than to the expected list of
all the merchandise in the category named by the caption.

The right column has three images each with text underneath like labeled
icons.  It looks like 3 links not 6.

To avoid this confusion I suggest something like one of the following.  Either:

a. make it so clicking on the image above other merchandise links to the other
merchandise listing not just the one product (and ditto for other categories).  Or

b. add name of each featured product such as firefox decal under each image
so the image has its own caption and other merchandise category is clearly a
separate link.

CORE-326714,"N.B.: Most people don't use builds with the code that this bug is complaining about -- it's not enabled in release builds since --disable-gnomeui defaults to doing a configure test for the version and the build machines don't *currently* have that version although that could change in the future.  But it does show up in builds that people do on relatively new distributions.

The GNOME icon code in modules/libpr0n/decoders/icon/gtk/ is really really slow.  I've described this on IRC in the past and some people had useful suggestions.  On my machine it takes a few hundred milliseconds *per icon*.  This is a significant slowdown just when opening a dialog that has OK and Cancel buttons (since we do two such icon loads in that case at least the first time).  But it's a much much more serious problem for bookmarks where we do an icon load for every single file: URL in any displayed bookmarks -- if a bookmarks folder or the personal toolbar has a lot of file: URLs in it this is a huge slowdown and can lead to multi-second delays waiting for bookmarks menus to open.

Using some printf(!) timing since profiling of things involving X server etc. can be a little unreliable the slowest pieces of nsIconChannel::InitWithGnome seem to be:
 * the call to gnome_icon_lookup typically around 300ms
 * the g_object_unref of the icon theme (odd) typically around 50ms
 * the pixmap manipulation from there to the end of the function varies a lot -- sometimes it's almost instantaneous sometimes it's near 50ms sometimes in between

When I brought this up on IRC a bunch of people had suggestions for improving the last part but that's actually not the bulk of the time.

The code that defines NSS_LIBS and NSS_DEP_LIBS in configure.in uses continuation lines in the variable definition that is later used in an AC_SUBST( ...).  This is not allowed because the build system splits the sed script used to process all the AC_SUBST( ... )'s at 90 line boundaries which could end up being in the middle of a continuation line.

THe current situation is that adding any AC_SUBST( ... ) before the ones for NSS_LIBS and NSS_DEP_LIBS will result in a very difficult to figure out build failure.

I am not talking about black text on black background.

Basically some sites have text that Firefox will not render. Also highlighting it shows a strange behavior...the text does not appear rather your highlighting shows up but it is as if you are highlighting just a bunch of spaces.


I've noticed this sometimes before on websites that say like Here is the code and then they post the code and you see where the text should be but it's not there. If you highlight it it gets highlighted but it still doesn't appear.

Recently I've started noticing this a lot more. One of the sites I recently hit that has the problem is http://store.2600.com

To give an example initially the following method works fine when the program starts up and it does replace the URL in the frame where the old URL was loading.htm and the new URL is getuser.htm:

	parent.contentFrame.document.location.replace(getuserfile)

This command works therefore the method itself functions in Firefox.

However this method does not always function. This and other methods worked consistently in previous versions of Firefox and even in the IE browser. They still work in the IE browser but not in recent Firefox versions those released in updates during the last couple of months. As far as I can tell when the URLs on two frames are accessed in sequential commands then something blows up. For example these are two sequential commands in a function which used to work fine but now does not work in recent Firefox versions (neither in Linux nor Windows OS):

	parent.navscrn.document.location.reload()
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.replace(LessonURL)

If I look at the variable LessonURL immediately before the location.replace() method is called it is correct. However the location.href is exactly the same for the frame both before and after these commands are executed. The location.reload() method is executed and so is the location.replace() method but the URL is not changed to the new one.

I have also tried the following alternative methods using both variables and literal strings:
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.href = LessonURL
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.assign(LessonURL)
	parent.contentFrame.window.location.replace(LessonURL)
	parent.contentFrame.window.location.href = LessonURL
	parent.contentFrame.window.location.assign(LessonURL)
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.assign(file:///home/greg/Desktop/Greek%20Web%20Site/newfile.htm)
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.assign(file:///home/greg/Desktop/Greek Web Site/newfile.htm)

None of these methods work. I also tried the following commands to set the LessonURL to include the protocol:
	var tempLoc = parent.contentFrame.document.location.href
	// and also tried: var tempLoc = unescape(parent.contentFrame.document.location.href)
	tempLoc = tempLoc.substring(0tempLoc.lastIndexOf(/)+1) + LessonURL
	parent.contentFrame.document.location.assign(tempLoc)

I have tried almost every combination I can think of at this time. This is likely a bug reported elsewhere by now but I cannot find it in your database. So I am reporting it again.

Thanks. Greg.

I was using Thunderbird 1.5b1 for some time and it was working fine. But it
suddenly stopped loading new feeds. Even when i force 'Get Messages' its not
loading.
Then i moved to thunderbird 1.5b2  its again giving the same problem. 

Then I deleted my News & Blogs account and created a new one. In the new
account  in Manage subscriptions window when i added new feed the status
bar said verifying feeds and then the window hanged.

( My network connections are fine and i am able to see the feeds in firefox. )

I hate to to file this bug since i don't how to reproduce this. 
But i don't want to keep quite. I am a software developer and If someone
points me some resources to debug this issue I will be very happy to 
do that. I like to contribute to mozilla.org.

See upcoming testcase which crashes current trunk builds after a few reloads (reloads automatically).
The contenteditable attributes are necessary for the crash to happen so I guess this is a regression from bug 237964 somehow.

When connected to Quakenet (irc.eu.quakenet.org) and chatting in several
channels at once some (not all and not from any channel in particular)
[ct]SomeNick left undefined messages appear in a new tab called undefined.
The URL for this tab reads irc://quakenet/undefined. It does not happen on any
other network but always when connected to quakenet. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to the QuakeNet IRC Network and start chatting.

Actual Results:  
Notice how after some time a new tab called undefined will show up.
Observe how some user left channel messages where the channel name is always
undefined will mysteriously find their way to this tab.

Expected Results:  
The user left channel messages should quite obviously show up in the tabs
for the respective channels which the users mentioned in the messages left.",minor

Every time when I go to
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi?GoAheadAndLogIn=1
and press the Login-button (after I have entered user id and password) Mozilla
immediatly crashes. I have also experienced identical behaviour with 1.1b but 
then I unsinstalled 1.1b and installed 1.0 instead. Thus I do not have a build 
id for 1.1b at this time.

I can log in to bugzilla without any problems using Netscape Communicator

bugzilla using Mozilla 1.0 on Sun Sparc Solaris (Build ID: 2002061103). All 
mozilla installations where binary distributions downloaded from the Mozilla 
FTP server.

I will send in a TalkBack (Netscape Quality Feedback Agent - Gecko1.0) report

If Mozilla is linked without -Bsymbolic on FreeBSD most things work as
expected.  However if the browser is built with GTK2 and Xft support there are
symbol clashes (namely with Xft1 and Xft2 or with expat).  Both Linux and NetBSD
already use this option.

The one downside to enabling this is that a lot of unresolved symbol messages
are printed while building.  These appear to be harmless as the finished product
can resolve all the symbols.

This patch has been tested on FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE as well as 5.0-RELEASE and
-CURRENT.

When you load a page in Firefox the location bar makes some magic and decodes the URL making %c3%b6 for instance appearing as ö. All this is fine but when I just go to the location bar and press ENTER the encoding gets screwed up.

What I think Firefox does wrong: 
It doesn't remember what encoding the page loaded had (UTF-8) and therefore just encodes it as ISO-8859-1 or something like this. It should remember the encoding.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the URL in the URL field see that the textbox to the right contains höjning
2.Go to the location bar and press ENTER
3.See how the text box changes to h�jning

The URL encoding changed

Why is the Options... dialog modal? No changed in the options dialog will result in an immediate change of rendering of tabs or other parts of the window. So I don't understand why it should block the rest of the window. Furthermore if you are new to Firefox and you use a tutorial to change some props you can't switch between the tut and the options dialog (that's not quite comfortable). The only thing you could do is open another window of Firefox and change the options there.
So I think the options shouldn't be modal.

And another problem with child dialogs:
If I open the Add-ons dialog from the options dialog there are all three controls - close full size and minimize - but at least the minimize-control doesn't make any sense. If I minimize the addon dialog I still can't do anything in the options dialog because the addon dialog is modal too. Why? If I open the addon dialog from the menu Tools it isn't modal. But from Options it is. Doesn't make any sense to me...
(All the other dialogs opened from Options that have these three controls aren't modal.)

And last: In the Advanced tab of Options many buttons haven't got the ... at the end even tough they open a new dialog.

Setting a bookmark's Description to be the same its Keyword will make the custom
keyword for that bookmark not work. Erase the Description or change it to
something else and the custom keyword for that bookmark works again.

to be the same as the keyword so I would remember the keyword easily by just
browsing the bookmark manager.

We're sorry.  The browser you are currently using does not meet our 128-bit
encryption requirement.

To access Aetna Navigator™ your browser must use 128-bit encryption.  Should
you need to upgrade your browser the link to Netscape provided below is for

What is Encryption?
    Encryption scrambles data into unintelligible characters based on a secret
key.  Encryption increases the level of security for the information you send
from your browser over the Internet to the Aetna Navigator site.  Most browsers
support a minimum level of 40-bit encryption as well as a stronger 128-bit
encryption level.

    The Aetna Navigator site only supports 128-bit web browser encryption.  Even
though we use the more secure 128-bit encryption there is a certain amount of
risk involved in any Internet communication and Aetna cannot guarantee the
privacy and confidentiality of information exchanged in this manner.

    Understanding this if you would prefer to contact us by phone you can call
Member Services at the number on your ID card.  If you do not have an ID card
yet please contact your employer/group benefits office to obtain the toll-free
number.

Bugzilla devs indicate that requiring you to choose a product every time you want to clone a bug is the intended behavior.

From bug 355285 comment 0:

my definition of clone includes retaining the classification product
component and assignee/qa.

the reason i make a clone is so that i don't have to search for the
product/component/assignee/qa. if i wanted to file a new bug i'd have gone off
and filed a new bug.

the cloning we use involves changing basically a flag which basically indicates
a different branch.

steps:
1. file a bug in foopy/newpie/boopy against: assi:yippie qa:darpy with summary
peppy and comment hipp-hipp-horrip
2. click clone

expected results:
bug is prefilled with foopy/newpie/boopy against: assi:yippie qa:darpy with
summary peppy and comment hipp-hipp-horrip

actual results (in a heavily customized bugzilla):
product chooser!

---

From bug 355285 comment 9:

Yes I would expect clone to keep the component etc. That's the hardest part to
fill out.  My use case was that I needed to file a new bug for a similar task
and wasn't sure how to fill it out.  I found an old one that was correct and
hit clone.  *If* someone wants to file in a different component I think it's
just as trivial to *change* component as it is to pick one from scratch.

There are other comments in bug 355285 from users of other Bugzillas indicating other reasons why having clone clone without requiring a trip to the product chooser is desirable but I've just copied these two from regular bmo users.

with one exception.

The exception is that the 'edit comment as text'  doesn't have a rows
attribute which is required. We set the size using a style attribute. Mozilla
seems to ignore the rows attribute but I need to check if that is guarenteed.
That page only wokrs in mozilla ATM so I'm not worried about other browsers.

The mimetype warnings are all on the fact that we use text/javascript instead of
application/x-javascript. Was this a deliberate decision made for old IE
versions or something? If not I'll fix those too.

This is for 2.18 not 2.16 although the account/email/confirm.html.tmpl part
() may need to go into 2.16 since I can imagine browsers
having issues with that.

and alt to  and so on). Those that aren't include:

global/useful-links.html.tmpl: gmuck warns about inconcistant quote style so I
changed these to use  instead of ' (they were  because of how we were quoting
for TT)

search/form.html.tmpl: gmuck picked up on:

[%# Note: the  tag is unclosed at the end of this template %]

as not having an action attribute. Since the opening isn't in this template and
only one template uses this particular template I think its a fairly silly
comment so I removed it. I care because I want gmuck to become part of the

When a path is used to create its segments and they are inserted into it the xml representation is correct (as per firebug) but the pathSegList.getItem(0).pathSegTypeAsLetter returns wrong values for SVGPathSegCurvetoQuadraticAbs:ses and SVGPathSegCurvetoCubicSmoothAbs:ses return wrong letters.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have any page open. Even a simple like:


Letters fail




	Sorry this isn't one of those visually impressive problems.




Will suffice.
2. Execute the following code:
var svgns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg

var path1=document.createElementNS(svgnspath)
var sseg=path1.createSVGPathSegCurvetoCubicSmoothAbs(50402060)

var path2=document.createElementNS(svgnspath)
sseg=path2.createSVGPathSegCurvetoQuadraticAbs(50402060)
path2.pathSegList.appendItem(sseg)


alert(Should be S:+path1.pathSegList.getItem(0).pathSegTypeAsLetter)
alert(Should be Q:+path2.pathSegList.getItem(0).pathSegTypeAsLetter)


3.The alerts should state the problem. For Google Chrome and Opera show the correct ones so I'm pretty sure I'm not the one who's mixed up the letters.
Actual Results:  
Well the given letters are not the same as they are in the dom's view of the xml (seen from firebug) and the specification. This is shown by the alert boxes.

Expected Results:  
The SVGPathSegCurvetoQuadraticAbs should have Q as its pathSegTypeAsLetter and the SVGPathSegCurvetoCubicSmoothAbs S.",minor

valid xhtml1.1 document) with the extension html is rendered correctly.

This bug is not seen with Mozilla 1.7.5 or derivatives such as Firefox.

It is seen under 1.8a5 with and without the bug 268111 patch.

With later builds (either a6 or the latest nightly - I'll confirm later)
the bug is still present when the page loads but changing the window size fixes
it temporarily.",major

MAILNEWS_CORE-472005,"The bayesian filter tokenizer currently sees headers that are set by mailnews itself such as the keywords header. This causes some strange feedback effects particularly in the case of applying soft tags. Since the existance of the keyword itself is obviously a very strong indicator for soft tagging with that header then whether the header is present or not has a strong effect on the calculated trait match percent. This causes after-the-fact trait bayesian percentage calculations to differ dramatically in some cases from the cases where the filter is applied during normal message reciept which is very confusing.

It is actually worse than that. The most common time when you train with a keyword applied is when you are correcting a false positive. In that case the presence of the keyword in the message is an anti-indicator of the need for the keyword. This causes an oscillation in values as the keyword is removed if present or placed if absent on subsequent after-the-fact calculations.

I need to decide whether to hard-wire the tokenizer to ignore headers set by mailnews itself or implement some sort of interface to allow extensions to manipulate the tokenizer.",minor

As you all know bug 452610 made CalDAV-sched an user settable option disabled by default.  The problem is that means free/busy lookups are now disabled by default.  This results in a loss of critical functionality.

If we  leave the default setting we no longer get free/busy lookups.  This is something that worked in the previous release (0.8)

OTOH we get free/busy lookups if we enable the caldav scheduling option but we lose the ability to send invitations.  This is because the e-mail invitation is no longer generated and the caldav-sched invitation is not functional for our server (Bedework 3.4.1.1).

I consider this to be a regression since a critical feature (free/busy lookups) is no longer available.

NSS-488396,"The shared db/dbm split was made to try to remove code from the FIPS boundary. One way of doing that is to not FIPS validate the DBM code.

This would be fine normally as all the objects passed accross the sdb_ boundary (the interface to both sqlite and dbm) are all encrypted. The problem is DBM needs to decrypt that data and reencrypt it to preserve it's date interface. That means for dbm to be FIPS the legacy dbm code needs to be included in the FIPS boundary.

To date we believe the only thing that needs to happen to make this work is to include a .chk file and verify the dbm .so file when in FIPS mode.

DIRECTORY-174912,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible MSIE 6.0 Windows NT 5.1 Q312461 .NET CLR 1.0.3705)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0

The Mozilla SDK 5.0 client occasionally ignores requests when the LDAP server 
returns more than one referral.  With a little logging and tracing I find that 
some requests terminate parent requests before the parent completes receiving 
responses.  This results in lost entry results and even lost referrals.

In read1msg() of result.c a while-loop decreases the lr_outrefcnt of the 
parent associated with the finished referral below.  The loop finishes with lr 
pointing to the highest parent who has a positive lr_outrefcnt (after the 
subtraction) or simply the highest parent in the branch.  In either case 
read1msg() continues and frees everything at lr and below with 
nsldapi_free_request(lr) so the while-loop had better give us the highest 
completed lr or it will free outstanding requests.  Unfortunately my logs show 
that the while-loop can finish with an lr above requests who still have 
lr_res_msgtype==LDAP_RES_SEARCH_REFERENCE indicating that indeed the current 
code incorrectly frees outstanding requests.

Typically how does this happen?  Consider a system where referral generates 
requests looking like:

[r1]->[r2]->[r3]

Where arrows = children.

1.	 Assume [r3] just got a final response from the server setting its 
lr_res_msgtype to LDAP_RES_SEARCH_RESULT and read1msg() now enters the while-
loop.
2.	The loop goes up to [r2] to decrease its lr_outrefcnt to 0.
3.	What if [r2] isn’t done?  What if it is about to receive an entry?  Or 
another URL referral?  What if [r2]’s lr_res_msgtype==LDAP_RES_SEARCH_REFERENCE 
right now?  - the while-loop ignores it!  The loop only sees [r2]’s 
lr_outrefcnt==0 and continues up to set lr=[r1].
4.	Assume [r1] already has lr_res_msgtype==LDAP_RES_SEARCH_REFERENCE – 
remember responses from the server arrive any time so although [r2] is 
incomplete [r1] may have completed ages ago.  Since [r2] was [r1]’s only 
referral [r1]’s lr_outrefcnt is now 0.
5.	The while-loop can’t go up further and lets lr rest at [r1].
6.	When we get to the “we recognize a request as complete when” 
conditions we see that [r1] satisfies all conditions.  Satisfying these 
conditions we enter the resource freeing code.
7.	When nsldapi_free_request(lr) starts freeing resources from the [r1] 
branch [r2] disappears though it’s not finished.

What can we do to stop this calamity?:
Placing an lr_res_msgtype check before traversing up to the parent can correct 
this.  All we have to do is stop at [r2] and [r2] will fail the conditions that 
are required to execute nsldapi_free_request(lr).  To stop at [r2] we 
immediately break the loop when lr_res_msgtype==LDAP_RES_SEARCH_REFERENCE in 
the while-loop right after merge_error_info() before lr=lr->lr_parent 
traverses up.  When we finally get a result response for [r2] we’ll execute 
this loop again and this time lr->lr_res_msgtype should be 
LDAP_RES_SEARCH_RESULT which will let us continue and free [r2] properly.  Note 
that we subtract the parent’s lr_outrefcnt at the end of the previous iteration 
of the same while-loop so its lr_outrefcnt is always current even with the new 
loop breaker.

The fix looks like:
	while ( lr->lr_parent != NULL ) {
		merge_error_info( ld lr->lr_parent lr )
		if( lr->lr_res_msgtype == LDAP_RES_SEARCH_REFERENCE ) // new
			break                                        // new
		lr = lr->lr_parent
		if ( --lr->lr_outrefcnt > 0 )
			break
	}


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up three server instances A B C.
2. Set up referrals A-->B-->C.
3. Execute any sub search from A that must refer to B then C.
4. Repeat step #3 until symptoms surface and an expected entry cannot be found.
Actual Results:  
After about an hour of looping 1 entry in the directory cannot be found.  
LDAP_SUCCESS returns as if no entries were expected.  Executing one more search 
for the same entry reveals it indeed should've have been found.  It seems the 
faster the computer the longer it takes for the symptoms to appear.

Expected Results:  
Returned the entry from the directory ... consistantly.

Build Identifier: 

Running the tests with ant-junit all reports a lot of failed tests. Running tests as explained at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Running_the_Rhino_tests doesn't report any failure (at least for interpreted mode).
This shows that there is a big problem at least in one of the two methods.

The first failing test reported when running the tests as junit tests is lc3/ArrayMethods/object-001.js. Which is not reported as failing by JsDriver.

If I add following as first statement of JsDriver.excluded:
            if (!path.contains(lc3/ArrayMethods/object-001.js))
            	return true
and run JsDriver tests again then only this single test is run... and if fails exactly like when running it as unit test.

For me this shows a really big problem in the tests. Particularly this seems to mean that we can't trust the results of JsDriver and that the unit test result are (more?) correct. In which case a lot of tests fail currently!

Additionally do we really need JsDriver? It is important to be able to build and run the tests in automatic build process and have usable results that we can trust. JUnit seems better suited for this purpose.

I set the severity of this issue as critical because I think that we can't have any reliable information on Rhino's quality as long as it is not fixed.

Forgive me if I'm missing something but browsing through the code it appears
that the password cache for HTTP remembers realm hostname and port to
determine if it should replay a password to a site that it had seen previously.
 I believe the list should actually be realm hostname port and whether it was
a secure site.  Just because a site is on port 443 it does not mean that the
site is under SSL.   

An attacker could allow you to enter your password to your secure site then
latter during the same browsing session spoof DNS for a non-ssl version of the
same url you hit previously on the same port.  Your browser would happily send 
your password to them no SSL required.

I haven't had time to test this theory.

v1 + mixed content tests reenable

This is cause for mixed content tests (bug 452401) intermittent failures.

nsDocLoader maps request info by request (nsIRequest) address in its mRequestInfoHash hash table. When a request address get recycled and reused for another request (not unlikely to happen) existing info for already dead request is reused.

In nsDocLoader::OnProgress there is a condition 'if (!info->mUploading && (nsInt64(0) == info->mCurrentProgress) && (nsInt64(0) == info->mMaxProgress))' that have to pass only when we get the first OnProgress notify from a request (i.e. when progress of a request is 0) to prevent multiple StateChange notifications to upper levels. 

When existing request info is reused the condition doesn't pass even ones.

This OnProgress notification is critical for the security UI. When it doesn't get it for a request that request got ignored by security UI and we may occasionally get fully secure state for actual mixed content page.

Solution is to remove the request info from the hash table when we get OnStopRequest.",major

  Reason: Incompatible library version: Security requires version 9.0.0 or later but libsqlite3.dylib provides version 1.0.0

This is because the shell script alters DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH such that the libsqlite3.dylib file in the Firefox directory takes precedence over the one in /usr/lib and the Firefox version is incompatible with Snow Leopard.

Executing the firefox-bin binary directly does not cause this problem since the default DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is being used.

Hi

When I search on Subject or Sender in threaded mode in the main mail window I systematically get a crash when searching for all mails sent by my wife. Lots of other searches go fine but that one blows up every time. I'm afraid I haven't been able to spot another theme or reproduce a simpler test case.

When I'm not in threaded mode the search goes fine (I checked once I say the thread sorts in the stack trace included below from Apple's bug reporting tool).

On a side note (certainly already reported) viewing unread mails in threaded mode has lots of problems - if there are many mails unread in a thread clicking to open the thread doesn't usually work on Windows or Mac.

Cheers
Dave.

The basic scenario is that I am using a laptop which I move frequently but
almost never shutdown.  I go on and off wired and wireless networks several
times per day.  Perhaps 25%-50% of the time Firefox pegs the CPU when I am
restoring from sleep mode.  This makes the wake-up take forever.  

It seems to be related to the fact that there's no network available yesterday
CPU usage spiked right after I disabled my wireless card.  (Which I always do
using the plug/play icons in the taskbar.)

Firefox usually returns to normal behavior after a few minutes although
sometimes it can take up to 15-20 minutes.

Admittedly I haven't got a 100% reproducible scenanrio here.  But it happens to
me several times a week and is very frustrating.

We were finally able to isolate the behavior to a few lines of html and javascript (see the welcome.jsp discussed later). The faulty behavior occurs more often when the complexity of the page increases however the welcome.jsp demonstrates the problem quite well if you let it run for a while. After the welcome.jsp is loaded the javascript will load the return_to_welcome.jsp which is identical but it redirects back to welcome.jsp. When the resource loading goes bad it will throw up an alert saying it cannot find the clock widget. The clock widget is a widget provided by dojo. We are using dojo 0.4.

We added logging to the javascript and this is displayed on the page when resource loading goes bad:

You can run the example at:

http://www.vodafonegroup.eu:8080/jsp-ex ... elcome.jsp

If you want I can tar up the war file or even the complete tomcat.

The logging clearly shows that the onLoad event is fired *BEFORE* all the javascript has been loaded. The issue is most easily reproducible on windows (we used both win2k and xp in a VM) but we've also seen it on OSX. However for the example code provided we could only make it happen on windows. All runs fine in FF2 or IE6+. We used a clean FF3 with no plugins.

BTW it is key to use a jsp and *not* static HTML or else the browser figures out that it can cache the entire page and the issue will not surface. Sometimes the issue will issue on the first load sometimes it will take a few minutes..

Another maybe related issue is that we sometimes see that CSS is not loaded. I also actually see this quite often when I go to www.cnn.com with ff3.

BTW in FF2 you can actually see the clock widget on the welcome.jsp not so in ff3.

You can actually see from the bad results (the first set) that the dj_load_init() method is triggerd TWICE before the end of the inline script is run. Looking closely you can see that the DomContentLoaded event and the window onload event both fired prematurely.

In addtion the the dj_load_init() method is only registered as a listener for DomContentLoaded -- not the window.onload event.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
We found the smallest amount of html/javascript that still demonstrates the behavior to make it easier to understand the issue. The downside is that it happens less frequently. To reproduce just load up 
http://www.vodafonegroup.eu:8080/jsp-examples/ff3/welcome.jsp
and see it alternating between this page and the return_to_welcome.jsp page. 

After a while an alert pops up saying Could not find Clock!!! This is when the onLoad event has fired prematurely.

Actual Results:  
You get the alert and our logging output appears on the screen

The problem seems to be most prevalent on windows. We can send you server side code on request.

This issue is causing major havoc on our site which is heavily web2.0. And when the javascript loading breaks it leaves the site pretty much broken. We see this issue in ff3 only (tested ff2+ IE6/7 Safari).

The issue is in URL bar rendering.  If a very long document.location is set via javascript the integer overflow is reachable.  The files at the above location show this bug for each.  

The affected code in pango is in pango_glyph_string_set_size:
An overflow check when doubling the size neglects the overflow possible on the subsequent allocation:
  string->glyphs = g_realloc (string->glyphs string->space * sizeof (PangoGlyphInfo))

I don't have a live exploit but this looks exploitable.  I have not yet gotten this reported upstream to libpango.  It is pending on their mailing list and I've received no response.

Because of their delay and Apple's delay I thought it would make the most sense to put a maximum limit on the document.location.

This will be referenced with advisory oCERT-2009-001.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto a pango crasher in http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/
   E.g. http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/pango_2.html
2. Crash.

Depending on how the overflow is handled you can get it to proceed without a crash.

(Note I've been tinkering with the crashers so there's nothing special about the different versions just a few tweaks.)
Actual Results:  
In camino it is often a NULL deref.  I can get a few other random stack-addresses visible but I haven't done a thorough analysis on the Apple libraries to know.

In ff pango exposes the num_glyphs after a successful underallocation.  If this is used for writing to the glyph array it will result in heap corruption.

Expected Results:  
Maximum URL length and/or integer overflow checks in libpango/ripc would stop this.

Please let me know if I can help coordinate anything.  I can be reached at my personal address: redpig@dataspill.org or at my oCERT addr: redpig@ocert.org.

I will be pursuing getting this upstream to pango but if you have any contacts that can help that'd be great.

In addition if you have some idea for Camino fixes if you plan to release the crashers please let me know in advance.  I would like to negotiate some embargo date with Apple if possible but who knows.",critical

screenshot

When you have a huge list of saved searches it's hard to track those you share with others. We should add a class to them to distinguish them more easily.

In the attached screenshot one of them is easily visible because it has an additional string appended to it (shared with 8 users) but the other one is almost invisible.

While we are on it the shared with ... string should be on its own line because wrapping here is really not nice.",minor

Are there any examples for PerLDAP using controls specifically VLV or
persistent searches?

Tried a few things after reading the C SDK and the Mozilla::LDAP::API
docs but I can't seem to even get a successful result from a
ldap_create_sort_control() or ldap_create_virtuallist_control() call.
They always seem to return a Bad parameter to an ldap routine error.

Thanks

Rhino uses org.mozilla.javascript.Kit.semicolonSplit() in order to split strings into string arrays during initialization of error constructors and standard java packages. I guess this goes back to a time when Java didn't support literal array initializers although I'm not sure - they seem to have been in the Java language specification 1.0 already: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/first_edition/html/10.doc.html#11358.

When an automated test needs to temporarily replace a standard XPCOM component
with a mock implementation four steps are required:
 * Preserve the original factory
 * Register the mock factory
 * Unregister the mock factory
 * Restore the original factory

See this implemented in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/content/tests/browser/browser_bug471962.js#104

Currently there is at least one test that doesn't restore the original factory:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/tests/chrome/test_bug_412360.xul

It would be useful to have a shared component to handle these steps usable
from all the JavaScript-based testing frameworks.

The object would register the factory on construction then unregister it
when its dispose() method is explicitly called. For example:



var mockObject = {
  QueryInterface: function() { ... }
  ...
}

var registerer = new MockObjectRegisterer(mockObject contractID ...)
try {
  ...call the functions that need the mock object...
} finally {
  registerer.dispose()
}

This function has the following snippet of code:

584      * adjusting the output length.

Nothing wrong here except that I've got a unit test that ends up hitting the assert when trying to decrypt some data with the wrong password... The final padding block is thus garbage (as one would expect).

The unfortunate effect is that when running tests against a debug build the assert is fatal (process crashes). The fix would be to just remove like 588 as the line below it checks the same thing and returns an error.",minor

firefox crashes immediately and unrecoverably with the two sqlite version PRAGMA queries (user_version and schema_version) if you call the created statement's getColumnName() method on the results

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
sample code:

----------------------------------
var sql = PRAGMA schema_version
var storage_svc = Components.classes[@mozilla.org/storage/service1].getService(Components.interfaces.mozIStorageService)
var conn = storage_svc.openDatabase(ANY_SQLITE_DB)
var statement = conn.createStatement(sql)
var data = []
while (statement.executeStep()) {
  var row = []
  for (var i=0k=statement.columnCount i<k i++) {
    row[statement.getColumnName(i)] = statement.getUTF8String(i)
  }
  data.push(row)
}
----------------------------------

stepping in via the venkman debugger i can see that the specific part crashing firefox is statement.getColumnName(i). 
Actual Results:  
firefox crashes unrecoverably

Expected Results:  
a result for the sqlite schema_version or user_version PRAGMA commands

the crash is severe and could possibly be indicative of some nasty edge case lower down in the sqlite wrapper. still i guess not too many people are routinely calling PRAGMA commands. 

(i've put a workaround in my own extension to explicitly detect and handle these sql constructions separately)

Firefox will ask if you wish to subscribe and you have the option of choosing a reader.

Choose the firefox application as a reader.

Select the check box: Open Feeds with my chosen reader automatically skipping the preview page.

Choose subscribe now. 

Firefox goes into an apparent infinite loop opening page after page seemingly without end and also steals focus on my OS. The pages seem to be blank mozilla not having time to draw them (?) while it opens new tabs. Probably they were to show the feed view.

Furthermore the next time you deign in the future to visit any url to an atom or rss feed firefox will again immediately begin spawning tabs or windows. This makes it difficult to correct the mistake you've made in your settings.

I think this bug is serious since it is hard for the average user once he's chosen the mistaken route I've specified to correct his firefox settings. He has to have some knowledge of the preferences UI to which he needn't originally have been exposed.

My company uses a stock Exchange 6 installation with Outlook Web Access enabled.
 (Sorry I can't provide a login to test.)

Using Firefox 0.9.3 the page loads and operates normally.
Using Firefox 0.10.0 (20040911) the site prompts for username and password (via
HTTP-Auth) but the page never loads.  No page UI is ever displayed.

IE of course works fine.

Using LiveHTTPHeaders it appears that Firefox is providing badly
hashed/encrypted login strings and gets into an infinite request loop with the
server.  (See additional information.)

For each GET request the Negotiate header uses a different hash string varying
in length

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Visit OWA site
2.  Enter user/pass in HTTP Auth dialog
3.  Watch LiveHTTPHeaders for looping requests

Actual Results:  
Infinite loop of requests

Expected Results:  
Site display

These are two separate request/response headers from the infinite loop that
occurs after requesting the site.

The table.html.tmpl template makes use of HTML  and

using the  tag.  The solution is to specify the class in each

increase the size of the generated HTML by a fair amount.  I can

5. Under Tools-->Options disable both Javascript and Java
6. Visit http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/05/1065292455917.html
7. Notice that Java does not launch (i.e. no icon in the XP system tray)
8. Now go back to Tools-->Options and enable only Javascript (you can also
enable but disable common annoyances if you like - it will not make a
difference) but leave Java disabled.
9. Once again visit http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/05/1065292455917.html
10. This time you should notice that Java has launced because the Java icon
appears in the XP system tray!

we're using some changes to nsHttpTransaction but the general problem is 
possible without our changes (it just takes more luck and cycles we're good at 
finding problems with fewer cycles).

bug for it. this is really a blocker for our current product release cycle.",critical

BUGZILLA-278148,"Two bugs have already been filed on this issue: bug 244756 and bug 277303. 
Unfortunately while the patches on both were reviewed and approved neither 
one actually works. :(

With the latest patch from bug 277303 applied I get the following output from 
checksetup.pl:

Fixing Indexes and Uniqueness.
DBD::mysql::st execute failed: You have an error in your SQL syntax 
near 'PRIMARY' at line 1 at ./checksetup.pl line 2321.
DBD::mysql::st fetchrow_arrayref failed: You have an error in your SQL syntax 
near 'PRIMARY' at line 1 at ./checksetup.pl line 2312.


The reason for this is that DropIndexes makes no allowance for the idea that it 
may ever have to drop a PRIMARY key. To do so requires this syntax:

   ALTER TABLE milestones DROP PRIMARY KEY

Perusal of the code in DropIndexes shows that it can only produce the following 
syntax:

   ALTER TABLE milestones DROP INDEX PRIMARY

There are two approaches to fixing this: either fix DropIndexes so that it 
handles PRIMARY key drops properly or just add the above line with the correct 
syntax in place of the DropIndexes call. The former is 'better' the latter 
is 'faster'... and at this particular moment with 2.18 release so near speed 
may be more important.",major

Every time I use Firefox I resize and reposition the window.
When I close it it doesn't seem to store this information anywhere and the next time I open it it is back to the original position and size.

The chosen position and size appears to be top left and 996 x 1160 - although that may just have been what I last used under FireFox 1.0

It has been suggested to me that this is somehow controlled by the file localstore.rdf however when I check mine in c:\program files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\profile it has not changed since the day I installed this new version.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Browser
2. change window size and/or position
3. close browser
4. start browser again
5. size and position have reverted to what they were before the changes
Actual Results:

JSS-112330,"with a fresh copy of a .netscape directory I initialize the Internal Key
Storage using the browser I give it a password close the browser.

I run a JSS program that does the following:

access the token so I am asked for a password. After that I request a change of
password using:
CryptoToken.changePassword(new ConsolePasswordCallback() new
ConsolePasswordCallback())

the first time it asks for the old password I make a mistake on purpose then I
give it the right password and then a new password.

the program breaks either when giving the new password or when giving the old
password the second time. If it doesnt break I inmediatly run the same program
again following the same procedure as before and it will surely break at one
of the two aforementioned points.

See the URL above. 31 piecharts are drawn by javascript after it requests data from the server. These piecharts are incompletely rendered on the page - less than a quarter of the circles is rendered. Covering and uncovering the window then renders the correct complete image. Even pulling down a menu causes the area underneath to be repainted correctly. Note that when the data is refreshed (this happens every 10 seconds) some more of the pies is rendered but not all of them.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the above URL.


Actual Results:  
The SVG piecharts are only partially rendered.

Expected Results:  
The SVG piecharts should be completely rendered.

This page renders fine in Firefox 1.5.

I'm submitting this as a major bug because it may be enough to prevent us upgrading. If we cannot trust it to correctly render dynamically updated status warnings (pies turning red in our case) we cannot use it. Of course you may have a different opinion.

I tried to produce a single file that shows the problem but it seem to only appear when the data is fetched separately from the SVG file. This makes me think it may be some kind of timing issue.",major

crash: All Mozilla windows are closed Dr. Watson and the NS feedback agent are
activated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add manually an event to your calendar file with time stamps (DTSTART/DTEND)
in GMT (with a 'Z' at the end of the time stamp) or add 'Z' to already existing
time stamps.
2. Deactivate the related calendar in the 'Calendars' tab.
3. Try to reactivate the related calendar in the 'Calendars' tab. (-> Crash)
4. Remove 'Z' from the time stamps.
5. Restart Mozilla calendar and reactivate the related calendar in the
'Calendars' tab.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla crashes after step 3 (also Mail and Browser are closed). After step 5
Mozilla works as usual.

Expected Results:  
After step 3 the calendar should display the event with 'Z' at the end of time
stamps correctly converted into local time (as it does on Win98 for example).

Right now we only support the accessible table interfaces if a real  is actually used.

Unfortunately this may be quite difficult to implement.

We either need to:
1) allow an nsAccessible to QI to nsIAccessibleTable (but only when the appropriate role is attached) or 
2) we need to create a new type of object when grid or treegrid is used

I understand that the address operator is expecting an lvalue but I can't figure
out why its rejecting the one being passed in.  This seems to be working for the
tier-1 platforms.  It may be an ANSI compliance issue or a quirk in the aCC
compiler I dunno for sure.  Here is an excerpt from the cpp file that sets
overlayFile:

..........
..........
  nsCAutoString overlayFile

  // Retrieve the mInner data source.
  overlayFile = resource:/chrome/
  overlayFile += package
  overlayFile += provider // provider already has a / in the front of it
  overlayFile += /
  overlayFile += overlays.rdf

1. Check Allow sites to set cookies 
2. Close Firefox
3. Go to my.yahoo.com

Actual Results:  
1. Instead of getting to my home page it goes to generic page with a sign in link. 
2. I sign in
3. It tells me Yahoo unable to set or retieve cookies and I must change mu settings.
4. I change setting as above and Yahoo works perfectly.
5. I close Firefox
6. I reopen firefox and go to my.yahoo.com
7. Repeats as above


Expected Results:  
Since I have stored an identity cookie which Firefox recognizes after I check Allow sites to set cookies Yahoo opens my personal home page.

This has not happened before. It just started happening about 5 days ago. I'm assuming Firefox updated itself with one or more patches at that time and one of them created this problem.
Since this has not been reported before It may be because of interaction with one of my installed extensions (I have many of them).",major

I maintain a small wiki which uses various methods to remain search enginge
friendly including a friendly URL.

However it appears as if the hosting server Sourceforge reports HTTP headers
which cause Mozilla to drop the POST of data. Specifically its HTTP/1.x 302
Found. Mozilla issues a GET request to the URL instead of a POST request with
the data.

Attached is the session log for Live HTTP Headers

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Post data to a form via POST
2. Server reports HTTP/1.x 302 Found
3. Mozilla reissues request with GET header data is lost.

Actual Results:  
Wiki software reports strange bug i.e. not being to able read any of the
data posted to it since Mozilla isn't posting it directly. All posted data is
lost.

CORE-397219,"Steps to reproduce:

1. Navigate to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core

2. Tab to a focusable object near the top of the page (e.g. the Reports link)

3. Launch Accerciser and locate a true label (e.g. the blocking1.8.1.8 label).  Select this label within Accerciser.

4. In Accerciser's iPython Console type the following:

  text = acc.queryText()
  text.setCaretOffset(3)

5. Alt Tab back to Minefield.  The caret should be within the label.  Arrow right or left to verify this.

6. Press Tab to move to the next focusable object

Expected results:  After step 5 focus would be removed from the location chosen in step 2.  After step 6 focus would move to the item that follows the label (e.g. the blocking1.8.1.8 combo box)

Actual results:  After step 5 focus is visually still at the location chosen in step 2.  After step 6 not surprisingly focus moves to the next focusable object that follows your location from step 2.

I am requesting that this be included among the other Firefox 3 Accessibility Commitments (bug 396346).  Aaron since I know you'll ask... :-)  I do not yet know if this is a regression or not.  My guess would be that it's something we just haven't noticed because so many forms fail to use proper labels. :-(  For those that do however the current behavior is confusing/disorienting.

Process Gecko events on demand using a CFRunLoopSource

At present Minefield processes Gecko events in a tight loop (repeated
calls to NS_ProcessNextEvent() in nsBaseAppShell::Run()) on the main
thread.  But this tight loop can be interrupted by modal activity (a
nested event loop that temporarily does its own event processing).
And unless the nested event loop also processes Gecko events Gecko
events will (temporarily) stop being processed.

Some of these nested event loops belong to the browser so they
(presumably) can take responsibility for processing Gecko events as
needed.  But others belong to the OS which knows nothing of Gecko
events.  Examples are native menus and context menus (only Camino
uses native context menus) plus the modal loop that runs while
someone is using a window's resize region (in the lower-right
corner) to resize it.  While these native event loops are running
no Gecko events are processed.  (For more information see bug 356720.)

The current nsAppShell.mm contains code (in ProcessGeckoEvents() and
ScheduleNativeEventCallback()) that's supposed to get around this
problem by also processing Gecko events on demand (triggered from
nsBaseAppShell::OnDispatchedEvent()).  But (for obscure timing
reasons about which more below) this code currently never processes
any Gecko events if we're also processing Gecko events in a tight loop
(in nsBaseAppShell::Run()).

My patch fixes this problem by no longer processing Gecko events in a
tight loop -- it _only_ processes Gecko events on demand.  As a
result Gecko events get processed even during native modal event
loops (and bug 356720 stops happening).

Several other changes were needed to make processing Gecko events only
on demand via a CFRunLoopSource work properly -- they're noted in the
patch's comments.

Camino currently only processes Gecko events on demand (it doesn't
call nsAppShell::Run() and doesn't process them in a tight loop).
But it uses a different method to schedule those events (not a
CFRunLoopSource) which still allows the processing of Gecko events to
stop during native modal event loops.  My patch's method fixes this
problem.

In principle it'd be nice to be able to process Gecko events on
demand _and also_ in a tight loop.  But that would require changes to
cross-platform widget code (in nsBaseAppShell.cpp particularly in
NativeEventCallback() and DoProcessNextNativeEvent()).

As far as I can tell my patch doesn't cause any event starvation
(Gecko or native).

Note (quoting from a comment in my patch):

nsBaseAppShell::NativeEventCallback() doesn't actually process any
Gecko events if elsewhere we're also processing Gecko events in a
tight loop (as happens in nsBaseAppShell::Run()) -- in that case
ProcessGeckoEvents() is always called while ProcessNextNativeEvent()
is running (called from nsBaseAppShell::OnProcessNextEvent()) and
mProcessingNextNativeEvent is always true (which makes
NativeEventCallback() take an early out).",major

FIREFOX_BUILD_SYSTEM-373362,"Recently nsSidebar.js in browser/components/sidebar/src/ was changed to being preprocessed.  This change when rebuilt in an existing tree caused nsSidebar.js in the *srcdir* to end up blank.  (peterv checked this in when checking in a large tree-wide change I hit it in my tree as well.)

Steps to reproduce:
 1. edit browser/components/sidebar/src/Makefile.in to change EXTRA_PP_COMPONENTS to EXTRA_COMPONENTS
 2. run make in objdir
 3. undo edit to makefile in
 4. run make in objdir

Actual results: nsSidebar.js is empty

I'm not sure if this is a bug or a request for enhancement.

When editing mail in Message Composer/Editor (especially when reformatting the quoted text) it is very convenient to have a keyboard hotkeys to delete text word by word (to the left or right from cursor) to delete to the beginning/end of the line and to delete the entire current line.

Unfortunately Thunderbird does not support such a hotkeys. Can I ask you to consider implementing this feature?

Reproduction

3. Check bugzilla bug again. (Reload to be sure you may even restart)

pref(font.size.fixed.x-western 14)

fine (goes where it's supposed to) but if I try to use a link like this in the

This is contrary to the behaviour I am used to with add-ons such as Google Browser Sync which stores its login details separately.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set FF to always clear Private Data when it is closed.
2. Set Saved Passwords to be cleared.


Expected Results:  
When I performed the above steps Weave couldn't login when FF was restarted.

Weave should either store the passwords separately from the saved passwords system or warn the user that their options prevent the login details from being saved.",minor

NSS-70992,"Here's a set of patches that allows the NSS 3.2 release to be compiled
on BSD/OS 4.2.

The first several of the patches are pretty straightforward.

The patches to security/nss/cmd/platlibs.mk have a comment in them
saying they are a hack and indeed they are.  The problem they
work around is having a reference to PR_Assert() in the libnss3.so
library.  This happens because the libnss3.so library is *always*
built with -DDEBUG.  It should be built like the nspr library
and honor the user's settings for debug/non-debug versions of the build.
The inclusion of libswft on the link lines allows the utilities to build
because libswft has a stub reference to PR_Assert() in it.

I'm not exactly sure why I had to make the patch to
security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c -- it looks like MAX_DIGIT is undefined
coming into that piece of code (line 2456).  Stubbing out the offending
preprocessor line works around the problem.

The patch to security/nss/lib/ssl/unix_err.c is a lame workaround for
the unconditional inclusion of the poll.h file which should not be done
on all platforms.  I would claim that the problem lies in the unconditional
inclusion of this file.

Finally there is a patch which will create the
mozilla/security/coreconf/BSD_OS.mk
file which is needed (until autoconf rules the land) to get the NSS
library to build on BSD/OS.

Thanks for your attention.

message XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. Expected:
. Line Number 181 Column 5: .. (reported 
A greater set of 
- entity definitions in conjunction with 
- script tags with file references
leading to XML mismatched tag message

text is sometimes showing random junk e.g. out of Entity definitions)

looks like a buffer overrun error: vanishing 
- when some Entity declarations killed or 
- scripts wirh external file references are killed

source using xhtml-math-svg/xhtml-math-svg.dtd

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Additional Information is holding a nearly minimum XML file to reproduce
the error
2. start the file NotMismatched.xml (the file checked with W3C so far as
possible is not mismatched and - without SVG - running under firefox)
3. to disappear: take away first or last half of the Entities for greek
uppercase letters or (alternatively) all script tags with external references

Actual Results:  
I have to go back to build 2004112523
1. XML mismatched tag message often with crazy additional messages
XML Parsing Error: mismatched tag. 
   Expected:  etc.
2. some - maybe wrong - changes leading to crashes (automatically reported)
3. killing all script tags with references to files a page is built up
   also when changing the string in <html xmlns=http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml
xmlns:sv... 

Expected Results:  
A RESULT LIKE THAT SEEN BY FIREFOX or better (not SVG version)
builds up to 2004112523 were processing sufficiently the SVG DOM acting as
expected.
Hoped to get marker functionality and have seen some - after killing all script
references.

reasons see http://www.deskmod.com/?show=news&nid=1942.

When a user hits View -> Apply Theme -> Get New Themes s/he is redirected to

NSS-115951,"On platforms where freebl is a separate DSO from libNSS3 
(e.g. Solaris for Sparc and HPUX for PARisc)
the code that loads the freebl DSO allocates and then leaks a 
BLLibrary structure.  

I can see several ways to fix this:

a) free it in freebl_LoadDSO prior to returning PR_SUCCESS or 

b) have a static BLLibrary structure instead of dynamically allocating 
and freeing it or 

c) keep a static copy of the pointer to the BLLibrary and have 
BL_Cleanup() (a function down at the bottom of loader.c) call 
bl_UnloadLibrary with it.  In this case the PRCallOnce flag in
freebl_RunLoaderOnce should also be cleared by BL_Cleanup so that 
if an application reinitializes NSS after calling BL_Cleanup the 
library will get reloaded properly.

When using text zoom (option checked in view menu) and using the mouse scroll buttons to zoom the zoom will be allowed both higher and lower than the maximum and minimum zoom.  Then it seems to realize that you've exceeded the limit and redraws at the min/max or sometimes a step above or below the min or max.

If you zoom out quite quickly for example the page can flip down several zoom levels and appear very small then flip back to the maximum zoom level.

Contrast that to the full zoom which will not zoom outside the limits at all.  It's rock solid.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set text zoom View->Zoom->Text Zoom Only
2. Navigate to a text-heavy page
3. Use Ctrl-Mouse Scroll to zoom to minimum and maximum
4. Attempt to zoom beyond minimum and maximum
Actual Results:  
Observe flash to incorrect zoom level then back to correct min or max

Expected Results:  
Should not display at an out of range zoom level at all it should check the zoom level before refreshing the first time.  Try this in full zoom mode and the correct behaviour is observed.",trivial

Build Identifier: The bug order (js_FinishRuntimeScriptState --> js_SweepScriptFilenames) can still occur and cause crash

Dear developers:
    I am investigating the bug order (js_FinishRuntimeScriptState --> js_SweepScriptFilenames) in latest javascript code in hg repository. In this bug order js_FinishRuntimeScriptState will destroy a hash table then js_SweepScriptFilenames will access this table causing a crash. I have used sempahores to successfully enforce a feasible schedule in latest source code to prove that this bug order can still happen.
    
    Although this bug can be hidden by another fix for another bug 131246 (the fix for this bug is adding NULL check at js_{MarkSweep}AtomState) this bug order is very dangerous. In the past 7 years (starting from the bug 133773 at 2002) developers have tried some ordering mechanisms like js_WaitForGC to avoid this bug order but failed.

    The corresponding bug order in old code (js-1.5) is (js_FreeAtomState --> js_{MarkSweep}AtomState). Regarding the fixes in bug 133773 my schedule can cause a crash (please refer to the 133773 and 477021 bug pages for more details) because the NULL check at js_{MarkSweep}AtomState has not been deployed when bug 133773 is being fixed. This means that the fix in bug 133773 actually can not fix 133773 and a crash can still occur after the patches in 133773 are added.

    Since I am using semaphores this bug can happen at each execution.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add my patch to latest js source code in hg repository.
2. Run my simple testcase (just start two threads and only two threads).
3. Bug occur.
Actual Results:  
Below is my output which shows js_FinishRuntimeScriptState is called in one thread and then js_{MarkSweep}ScriptFilenames is called in another thread:

If you replace an inline element containing a block element by a block element
the replaced element remains in layout but behaves like a ghost of the new
element. It isn't in the DOM just in layout.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the testcase.
2. Click the test button.
3. Doubleclick the upper text.
4. Select all text and view the selection source (context menu).

Actual Results:  
text appears twice. If you try to select the upper one the lower one is
selected. In the DOM source you see the correct DOM tree however.


Expected Results:  
No visual change just an additional level of  inserted.


Note that an inline element containing a block element is not a normal case
(I found nothing in the spec about this case) but it occurs on real web pages
(e.g. ...) and interferes with my bookmarklet trying
to prettify those pages.

CORE-315728,"IDN processing is defined to only use characters in the Unicode 3.2 repertoire. However at least one character U+1160 'HANGUL JUNGSEONG FILLER' first defined in Unicode 4.0 can be shown to pass straight through the IDN name preparation logic as in this example:

   www.python.info 

is translated to:

   www.xn--python-eyy.info

instead of being blocked as an invalid IDN. Although this character has dodgy space-like rendering in the current Mozilla rendering code and is therefore a display-spoofing risk it is neither ignored nor prohibited in the current NAMEPREP rules designed to prevent these problems since the ignore/exclude lists in NAMEPREP do not address characters not in Unicode 3.2.  

Fortunately this particular character is currently caught be the hand-rolled ad-hoc IDN dodgy-display-character blacklist and is displayed as Punycode. However it would be better if the IDN code was strictly RFC-compliant with regard to characters not in Unicode 3.2 and that this name was thus treated as invalid during the IDN processing removing the need to catch it as a special case at display time.

Although this particular case is not a serious security problem _in itself_ it does suggest that the current IDN processing code is still not watertight and therefore that there may be other unknown IDN spoofing or other security problems lurking which are still not addressed by the current code.",major

When you put  tag into the form then it's transformed into a
simple  tag with two  - 2048 (High grade) and 1024
(Medium grade). But when looking in DOM inspector i've noticed that it
is possible to manipulate these objects (options to be precise)
trough JavaScript.

After manipulation KeygenHandler (source:
security/manager/ssl/src/nsKeygenHandler.cpp) is getting a different
string (other size) than it's expecting causing a crash. Since
KeygenHandler is depending on string values rather than option ID's
maybe it's possible to create a buffer overflow and inject external
code? I'm not a CPP guru so i don't know how to exploit this bug
please check that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Here's the code causing the crash (in the code i've changed the first
text value of Keygen options):




function testit() {
   var s
   s = document.getElementsByTagName(option)
   s[0].text='00000000000000000000000000000000000'
   document.crashform.submit()

3) Click on Nosenet or issue the command /attach Nosenet.

BUGZILLA-388232,"This is a regression due to bug 388045:

When you restrict a bug to some group both the reporter_accessible and cc_accessible attributes are automatically set to 0 as shown by the bug activity table:

 CC Accessible           1      0
 Reporter Accessible     1      0
 Group                          security

The reason is because process_bug.cgi doesn't make sure that these fields are defined first. When the bug is not restricted these checkboxes are not displayed and so set_foo_accessible() assumes their value to be 0.",major

When you have a form that the password manager fills in for you and you change
the password field and then submit sometimes you get a dialog:

Since clicking cancel does not _cancel_ the form submit it's probably a bad
choice of words.  Yes and No would probably be better.

The title says it all really. It appears that sorting Firefox extensions by
popularity yields results based on downloads per week. I can see no good reason
for this. The listings would be far more stable if total downloads were used as
the metric. (I would imagine that for most extensions download numbers do not
increase linearly with time and so we have extensions significantly jumping
about from day to day.)

On a related note the use of the word popular is slightly ambiguous because
it is not explitly clear what it refers to on u.m.o. It should be clarified that
it refers to download numbers.

This has happened multiple times now:  The same message appears twice in my inbox (inbox on IMAP server not local inbox).  Also some messages don't appear in my inbox but if I do a Search the Search does find the message and says it is in the inbox but then if I go to the inbox it definitely does not appear in the list.

I know this is a bug because if I use Rebuild Index on the inbox folder the duplicates disappear and the messages failing to appear then appear.  Rebuild Index fixes the problem... until it happens again some time later.

I am using IMAP and I am keeping the messages on the IMAP server so that I can access them from 2 different computers (both using Thunderbird).   I have the Offline Messages option enabled for all folders.   This combination of IMAP and Offline Messages is probably where the bug is -- I imagine this bug doesn't occur if using POP.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce this bug I expect that you must be doing what I am:  using IMAP and leaving the messages on the server (NOT downloading them to your local inbox folder).  i.e. the bug occurs with the inbox folder on the IMAP server and probably not with the local inbox folder.   Also I have the Offline Messages thing enabled for all folders that is probably also required to reproduce this bug.

This shows up visually to the user as Status: 400 Bad Request (invalid
multi-part post) in the spot where the output from processmail normally goes
when responding to a posted attachment.

The fundamental problem here appears to be that Bugzilla.pm is creating a
Bugzilla::CGI object when it's not called from a CGI environment (processmail is
a separate program).  Unfortunately all the environment variables are still
hanging around and there's nothing left on standard input to parse so it
totally dies.

Although I believe the symptoms of this will be fixed by moving processmail to a
module (which is another bug and almost ready for checkin I believe) the core
problem of automatically creating a CGI object from Bugzilla.pm should probably
be dealt with because Bugzilla.pm should really be loadable from any program
wishing to access Bugzilla whether it's CGI or not and trying to load CGI when
you're not in a CGI environment isn't always pretty as demonstrated here.",blocker

More research info it is not the document reference not working the problem 
is the returned popup window reference. Another weird thing is that if you do a 
reload (without closing the popup window) it will work. 

So my doubt is that at the moment window.open() returns it is still in the 
middle of creating the docshell and hense the window reference is not valid.

I am here for an hour or so. My initial investigation makes me think this some
kind of race condition. If I modify the test case to wait 3 seconds before
writing it works. Modified version follows

function splurge()

  var d = popup.document
  d.write('')

I am pretty sure we don't have this problem before (but not sure how long ago 
at that time popup window did not render about:blank initially). I used to test 
stuff like 
   popup = window.open(http://www.yahoo.com)
   popup.resizeTo(200300)
and it used to work. It doesn't anymore.



------- Additional Comments From Adam Lock 2001-06-26 14:14 -------

Eddie window methods should work immediately but the window.document
property won't work until the document viewer has been created and associated
with the window. And the document viewer won't be created until the uriloader
tells the docshell's content listener that there is some content to render. This
minor gap between the window opening and the document viewer being present.

Perhaps we could make process atomic for about:blank or wait in window.open
for the first content to arrive before returning? Ideas?



------- Additional Comments From Eddie Xu 2001-06-26 14:58 -------

The two lines 
   popup = window.open(http://www.yahoo.com)
   popup.resizeTo(200300)
is the exact codes I tested and it does not work. 

Unfortunately I can not block inside 
nsIEmbeddingSiteWindow::CreateBrowserWindow and peek for document viewer 
because it will never be created before I return from CreateBrowserWindow.



------- Additional Comments From Rick Potts 2001-06-27 01:07 -------

hey Eddie
I've spent some time tracing through both your cases (popup.document and
popup.resizeTo) and it turns out that they are related :-)

In the popup.document case it is just as Adam described - no document is
available...  Because nothing has loaded yet...

In the popup.resizeTo case things are a bit more funny :-)  It is basically
failing for the same reason - no document.  However in this situation it is
the Security Manager that is causing the failure...  Basically it is trying to
verify that you have the right to call resizeTo(...).  Unfortunately since no
document is available it cannot locate a principal...  This causes it to
silently fail :-(.

The funny part is that there is only a small window of time when you *are*
allowed to call resizeTo...  It will only succeed if it is called after
about:blank has loaded but before http://www.yahoo.com :-)  This is due to
security restrictions...

The bottom line is that when ever you create a new browser window you need to
create a nested message pump and block until the initial document (probably
about:blank) has been loaded into the webBrowser...

You can take a look at how mozilla does it at:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/appshell/src/nsXULWindow.cpp#1291

As you also noticed mfcEmbed does not do the right thing either when creating
new windows (or with modality in general)...

I'll see if we can fix up mfcEbbed to do the right thing as a simpler example :-)

Thanks Adam. 4517 does fix the painting problem but not the DOM. In your test 
case (the one with setTimeout(splurge() 3000)) if we change window.open
(about:blank) to window.open() like most site does your example won't work 
either. So this is what I am going to try on the embedding side:

After a popup window is created I am going to explicitly load about:blank and 
do a message pump and wait for the first OnStateChange(NETWORK DONE) to come 
in the new window before I return from CreateBrowserWindow. Sounds like a 
right direction to go?

<<Hi Eddie

The loading about:blank thing was a workaround while we sorted painting 
problems in new windows for bugscape 4517. This now appears to be fixed so I 
don't believe you need to do it anymore.

hmm...my initial try failed. Seems like if I do not return from 
CreateBrowserWindow the doc loading on the new window will never get completed.

Here is the codes:

        CWebBrowserContainer* pWebContainer = pNewBrowser-
>m_pWebBrowserContainer
        //Set it to true so that we can capture the document done event
        pWebContainer->m_bLoadingAboutBlank = TRUE
        ::ResetEvent(pWebContainer->m_hDocShellReadyEvent)

        pIWebNav->LoadURI(Labout:blank nsIWebNavigation::LOAD_FLAGS_NONE)
        _WaitForEvent(pWebContainer->m_hDocShellReadyEvent 5000)
    }
    return
}

STATE_IS_NETWORK))
        {

Eddie it may be possible to put some code into docshell that ensures that
about: protocols are loaded synchronously. I have made an initial attempt to do
this which does appear to work but it crashes almost immediatly after in the parser.

I'll attach a patch of my change in the hope that someone might be able to shed
light on the reason for the crash. To me it looks like the http channel is
sending data after I have already received the network stop notification via the
docshell's web progress listener.

hey Eddie
I ran into the same problem when I tried to add a sub-message-pump into mfcEmbed :-(

It turns out that before entering the nested event loop a new nsIEventQueue must
also be pushed !!!

I'm attaching a patch to
mozilla/embedding/browser/webBrowser/nsDocShellTreeOwner.cpp which pushes the
new event queue before calling nsIWebBrowserChrome::CreateBrowserWindow(...)

This seems to fix the problem...

When I successfully authenticate against my work's NTLM-authenticating Outlook Web Access on 
Microsoft Exchange 5.5 on IIS 3 (which is why I'm reluctant to give the URL) Mozilla crashes when I 
proceed further with navigation and at non-repeatable points in the code (using gdb). To the user this 
is just a crash and I had submitted a TalkBack through TalkBack a week or so ago. Using gdb it looks 
like the most common crash is Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS Could not access memory. 
though Program received signal SIGABRT Aborted. comes up sometimes too.

I'm currently trying to debug this but I though I'd at least put this bug here in case if y'all were 
planning on releasing Mozilla 1.7 soon. I would really like to have this bug fixed first and please let me 
know if you're working on this one too (I'll post more details as I find out more about this bug). I'm 
going to try to recompile with ElectricFence and see what might be writing out of bounds..

Thinking that the bug might be in mozilla/security/manager/ssl/src/nsNTLMAuthModule.cpp I pulled 
down revision 1.6 which was used in Mozilla 1.6 (NTLM on the same site works properly in 1.6) and 
re-made mozilla/security/manager/ssl. Unfortunately the crash still occurs so the bug might be 
elsewhere.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to a web site using NTLM
2. Navigate to another page
Actual Results:  
At the 9km view Mozilla crashes. Inside of gdb the crash seems to occur on non-repeatable code 
segments potentially indicating memory corruption in the NTLM authentication process somewhere.

Expected Results:  
Quite simply Mozilla should navigate to the requested page and not crash -).

Testcase: key3.db 

[Spinoff from bug 393835 which was getting long and messy.]

Reporter filed a bug regarding a loss of stored passwords after switching from Firefox 2 to a Filefix 3 alpha (trunk). We were able to recreate the problem using the reporter's key3.db (on XP and OS X).

If I enable password manager debugging I see this logged to the console when it's invoked:

PwMgr Storage: Initializing key3.db with default blank password.

This is generated in http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/components/passwordmgr/src/storage-Legacy.js:

 132         // Check to see if the internal PKCS#11 token has been initialized.
 133         // If not set a blank password.
 134         var tokenDB = Cc[@mozilla.org/security/pk11tokendb1]
 135                             .getService(Ci.nsIPK11TokenDB)
 136 
 137         var token = tokenDB.getInternalKeyToken()
 138         if (token.needsUserInit) {
 139             this.log(Initializing key3.db with default blank password.)
 140             token.initPassword()
 141         }

This indicates that |token.needsUserInit| is returning true for some reason. The branch version of this code is identical (although in C++).

[Another issue here is that the .initPassword() call seems to succeed but it shouldn't because there's already a master password set. I'm hoping that's just a side-effect of whatever is broken.]

To reproduce:
1) Create a new profile with Firefox 2 and quit browser.
2) Copy the attacked key3.db / signons2.txt into the new profile.
3) Start Firefox 2 view all passwords. Enter TestPwd01 when prompted for the master password. Note that there is 1 login stored (google.com user = username pass = password).
4) Quit Firefox 2 start Firefox 3.
5) Go to view all passwords... Note that the Use a Master Password checkbox is no longer checked and that no passwords appear to be stored.
6) Enabling the MP as TestPwd01 doesn't help.

I also tried to recreate to problem *without* using the reporter's key3.db by starting with a new FF2 profile doing a variety of things and then updating to Firefox 3... That always worked. I'm not sure what's special about this supplied key3.db but if it works fine in FF2 it ought to work fine in FF3.",critical

The video element shows a lot of tearing when the processor load is high. Especially the controls area seems to update out of sync with the rest of the video. Apparently the control area is always drawn no matter if it is currently visible or not.

The clean way to fix this would be finally changing the rendering path for opacity==0 to just skip rendering but for now it would probably be sufficient to just set the controls to visibility:hidden when the opacity approaches 0.

I really think this should be fixed prior to the debut of VIDEO in the next stable release as it makes even DVD quality video pretty much unwatchable.

Most text editors will save a file by either:

- writing out a new copy then renaming it over top of the old one or
- renaming the old file to a backup name then writing out a new copy

In either case the name now addresses a new inode and this seems to make mozilla sad on OS X.  If I reload it claims that the file is not found.  If I go to the URL bar and press enter it finds it back again.

If I go Back then Forward then Reload it works properly.  This would seem to suggest that something is being cached that gets used during Reload but discarded during Back/Forward or using the URL bar.

It doesn't always happen -- for example if I try it on the first local page I visit it doesn't seem to reproduce.  But if I click a link to another local page replacing that second page will reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two local html files say one.html with an href to two.html
2. Load one.html
3. Click the link to two.html
4. Rename a file over top of two.html or save it in vi

I'm using Mozilla agains a Cyrus 2.1.9 IMAP server. My INBOX has about 40
subfolders. Sometime after 2002-11-19 (that build works ok) the latest (1.3a)
code started to act badly. When you visit different IMAP subfolders suddenly
you just get the hour glass and no update of the folder contents. Moving on to
another folder usually works but going back to the hung folder gets you the
hour glass again. First I thought there was something wrong with the server but
for the latest week or so I have switched between the 20021119 build and newer
and it never happens with the old build but _always_ happens with newer ones.
If you exit Mozilla with an active hung folder connection the application
usually crashes (probably always but I'm not 100% sure about it).

SEAMONKEY-92947,"I was reading Sun's report on GNOME usability specifically this page
 and
found that after a few minutes some of the graphics had not been downloaded.
This problem also affects other pages where downloads of large amounts of
graphics can lead to timing out of page element downloads.

The only way I knew the download had effectively stopped was by looking at my
modem lights. Several years experience of the Internet has taught me that if
after two or three minutes of inactivity the action on a computer is likely to
have been aborted even if the computer has not told me. We need to tell the
user that this is the case in Mozilla.

The exact circumstances:

  The user has begun downloading a web page that included external elements
  commonly graphics. Some pages are slow to download for a variety of reasons
  and some fail to load completely.
What the user thinks:

  The user may have begun reading the page's content or interacting with it.
  Perhaps there are no immediate signs that the web browser has not completed
  it's downloading process or perhaps an error has occured which has failed to
  inform the user or not triggered an appropriate event in the software. Either
  way the user is either aware of the problem or not. In both cases the user
  has had no direct feedback from Mozilla.
What needs to happen:

  Mozilla needs to inform the user as to exactly what it's doing and if it has
reached a conclusion tell the user. In this case Mozilla has completed
downloading x/y components on the page (a simple counting process that isn't
displayed) and it is unknown what it is attempting to do now. If the network
connection for the remaining components has timed out or concluded in an error
(which is apparently the case) then the status bar should notify the user
appropriately. A suggestion is made below:

    Document: Done (x.xxx secs) - page could not be fully downloaded

  This tells the user that the document was rendered as best as could be
  acheived but that parts of the page were not successfully downloaded. Once
  this or other appropriate message has been displayed the throbber should 
  terminte animation the stop button should deactivate and the reload button
  should be re-activatable.

This bug should only cover the case whereby a page could be displayed but not
fully downloaded. Feedback given when a page tries to execute instructions in a
script and is in error are similar but should be covered in a seperate bug.

BUGZILLA-54901,"When using LDAP and no password is specified in the login screen the bind

This URL when the team has a game in progress overlays a Flash item on the
page (absolute positioning) that updates with the score of the game in progress.

The site uses browser-detection JavaScript to decide where to place the Flash
item.  The item is being misplaced in Gecko browsers.

Reduced testcase follows since the URL will not always illustrate the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the testcase in Gecko and in IE6 for comparison.
Actual Results:  
In IE6 the Flash item exactly overlays the player graphic it is positioned atop of.

In Gecko the Flash item is several pixels to the right off from the correct
position.

Expected Results:  
Proper placement in both browsers.

The page is very heavily a quirks-mode page.  However the fix is simple.  The
JavaScript determines the width of the page using:

if(Browser.nav){
//use Netscape information
var width = window.innerWidth
}else{
//use IE information
var width = document.body.clientWidth
}

In this quirks case Gecko will also achieve the correct result if it uses
document.body.clientWidth to calculate the page width.  The JavaScript should
route Gecko browsers according instead of lumping Gecko with Netscape browsers
of all sorts in the browser detect routine:

function Is (){   var agt=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase()
this.major = parseInt(navigator.appVersion)
this.minor = parseFloat(navigator.appVersion)
this.nav  = ((agt.indexOf('mozilla')!=-1) && ((agt.indexOf('spoofer')==-1) &&
(agt.indexOf('compatible') == -1)))

About the DNS resolve suppose the following case:
1. there are some (more than one) IP addresses which are mapped to the same host
name
2. only some of them is available
3. and only one is the true IP address
4. maybe this depands on what protocol we use...

We should try each IP adress until we find one which works and then remember
that returned address.

Should try them all but add an API to say return only this IP address entry
next time we ask then we return all addresses until we make a choice for some

Phoenix crashes directly on startup when it opens over my xterm and I was typing
something while it loaded.  This does not appear to happen if I was only typing

whole app crashes taking down all of the icons from the web pages in the

report in it's own right).  This would not bother me if there was a way to tell

I was confused by the current mouse wheel transaction.

A page has large scrollable view which has only vertical scrollbar. And the page has both scrollbars on a body.

For doing it I used the tilt wheel. But the horizontal scroll events were eaten by the child scrollable view. So there were not any changes in the view. Therefore I was confused some seconds (although I have implemented it).

If Automatically check for updates to: is enabled for Deer Parc (Firefox)

Parc are found but you DONT get notified for any update found for an Extension. 
The only way to see if there is an Extension-update available is to manually
open the EM scroll through all the Extensions and look out for the Update Now
Button behind each Extension.
Since Extension-updates will never be applied automatically and most
unexperienced Users will not look regularly into EM auto-check gets pretty
useless and most Users will be stuck with old Extensions.
This could be an potential security-risk with old unsafe Extensions (aka
Greasemonkey) not beeing updated. Therefore setting Severity to Major (and a

As reported in the newsgroup the mouse pointer and submenu highlighting are out of sync. This regards the main browser window as well as the bookmarks manager FF and SM (maybe also TB but no report yet)
I figured out that that's a fallout of bug 388359. Reverting the changes made in that bug brings the mouse pointer back in sync. It seems that the coordinates are changed as when you move the windows the highlighting of a menu entry seems to be fixed i. e. when you move the window up you get in sync when you move the window down the offset grows. Probably a fix of widget/src/os2/nsWindow.cpp would help?

While using a debug build you'll see occasional console messages like:

bit length overflow
code 4 bits 6->7

These are a side effect of bug 389273... We reencode favicons as PNGs the PNG encoder uses zlib and zlib barfs up messages like this now and then. The messages are harmless but can be a bit confusing to people watching the console while testing their own changes.

SEAMONKEY-158920,"I thought that we had fixed this at one point but it seems to have been
resurrected with the fix of bug 141834.  Cygwin uses /cygdrive/X/foo/bar to
denote the path to files on drive X if X is a cyg-mounted drive.  If the drive
is unmounted cygwin uses /X/foo/bar/.  Both conventions already screw up
non-cygwin programs but this is doubly annoying.  While both are easy enough to
check for via sed the first has far less of a chance of hitting a false positive.  

Using `cygpath -w` to translate either type of path into a regular dos path
seems to work.  However we do not use cygpath in the cygwin-wrapper script
since cygpath only works on a single argument not a list of arguments.  Instead
we assume that /cygdrive/ is used which breaks when the drive isn't cyg-mounted.

Potential solutions:
1) Start using cygpath in the wrapper script.  This is nasty as it means
invoking a separate process for *each* argument passed through the script.

2) Skip the wrapper script altogether.  In the main build we use the script as
little as possible.  It's still used for a handful of things though namely
running rc perl & nsinstall.  nsinstall is the main sore spot as it can accept
a variable number of filename args which each would need to be checked. NSPR &
LDAP use the wrapper pretty much everywhere.

3) Hack cygpath to accept multiple args so that we could use cygpath in the
wrapper in lieu of sed.  This means yet another entry from wintools or hoping
that cygnus will accept the changes and bump the minimum rev of the cygwin tools
required.",major

CORE-474160,"This bug is a regression from bug #441167.  Many parts of the user interface (for example Page Info --> General tab in SeaMonkey) now disregard the 24-hour setting for time as specified in the operating system settings making Mozilla no longer ISO8601-compatible.  Due to the changes in the patch that was committed it is no longer possible for the user to specify the date and time format that they want to use across the entire interface.

My proposed solution is to backout the patch from bug #441167 completely since if the user wants the interface to be in a certain language (including the date and time format) then they should select such a language in the preferences of the operating system.  Making it impossible for the user to make the selection in favour of supporting the full monty localisation of the application on wrongly configured operating systems is hardly acceptable and is a wrong approach in fixing bugs like 419220 (which by the way remains unfixed even with the introduction of this regression that were are now discussing).
