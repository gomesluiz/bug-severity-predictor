adding support for custom headers and cookie names involves two steps making session names configurable disabling auto start for sessions this can be accomplished in tiki setup base php though it means in turn that all pages dependent on the hard coded phpsessid cookie along with the basic session handler all need to be refactored to not assume there is a pre existing session i m looking at re implementing some session libs i have from before should do the trick this is a chicken egg problem since we want to use non default cookie names for ns rules we can t have the app auto setting the cookie while simultaneously passing cache headers we need to separate the behavior so it s consistent and predictable for the proxy cache eta is thurs this affect performance and for a couple of reasons it blocks bug ,4

i found it odd that relogin cgi didn t clear out someone s entry ies from the logincookies table after it logged them out relying instead on confirm login to clear them after they get days old a table can fill up fast that way i ve solved this by adding these two lines to relogin cgi just after the line that says require cgi pl connecttodatabase sendsql delete from logincookies where userid dbname to id url decode cookie bugzilla login the url decode is in there because i found i sometimes had instead of in the bugzilla login cookie and thus it wouldn t recognize the login just wanted to share ,1

the script called mozilla webtools miscstats genstats cgi assumes that bonsai and bugzilla are on the same server now that bugzilla is moving to a new server this script has to be updated to take that into account the quick and dirty solution is to run this script on both servers with each script generating only the statistics for its own server the one correct solution tm is to give each server access to the other s mysql installation but this requires thinking through the security issues involved since bugzilla is moving to the new server today i m going to implement the quick and dirty solution for the moment ,3

control the heap layout it is possible to execute arbitrary code here is some details on how to exploit the bug on linux use a javascript and allocate a lot of local buffer i found jc gc is called at the end of the javascript parsing before any image are loaded and will free all useless because local buffer thus it is easy to allocate in some global array a lot of little bufer to begin so we have the heap layout in a predictable state no hole allocate a few big buffer with isdigit valid character because there is no more heap hole the top chunk of the heap is expended when jc gc return some memory have been freed and thus following allocation will fall in these new heap hole when the image is processed the overflowed buffer will be followed by isdigit character this is junk in the prev size field of the next struct malloc chunk then a will be written on the lsb of the next size field of the next struct malloc chunk on the heap because it is easily possible to inject controlled character on the heap actually that could have been done in the few isdigit valid buffer it is possible to store fake information on the heap and tricks malloc free etc to parse them still in the scheme of doug lea malloc linux this will end by triggering the macro unlink which basically insert a heap chunk in a linked list thus writing a controlled pointer of us to a controlled address of us one can simply overwrite any function pointer like got entry saved eip pointer on the stack and hijack it to point to some injected shellcode exploitation is possible on bsd windows aswell actual results ability to execute whatever code you want expected results stop me ,3

in fx you can ctrl click on an about config entry and get a contextual menu which allows you to create a new pref for instance to add permissions default script which does not exist by default to lock a given setting to reset a setting to modify a setting to toggle a setting copy name or copy value the latter four seem somewhat superfluous esp as double click already toggles or modifies depending on the pref type camino shows the page contextual menu instead these are useful esp for qa and allow modifications and additions without the quit edit restart merry go round we currently have in camino for some prefs ,1

provide simple archive file format for update service given that bsdiff is designed to compress really well with bzip it is not ideal to use zip as the archive format for the update service i choose to write a very simple archive format that is basically a concatenation of all of the bzip compressed files with an index table tacked on to the end the archive format itself does not know about compression the amount of code required to read the archive format is very small so it helps minimize the codesize of the standalone updater executable i ve included code for a command line utility that makes it easy to perform the usual operations create extract and test this code is known to work on linux windows and mac osx ,2

as far as i can tell security mozilla org is always mailed when a new bug is filed with the security group box checked at least some of the time we re mailed when the group is un set but there are several times i know of that i have gone to a newly filed security bug and found that the security group checkmark has been removed but no mail is ever received this makes me wonder if there are times when the group is set on non new bugs that i m not getting mail for and of course not knowing when a bug goes public is itself a potentially bad thing could this have something to do with unconfirmed bugs i don t know if this has always been true but the recent ones that have exhibited this problem were all unco bugs could the security mozilla org account be set not to be mailed on unco bugs this problem might be since the recent bmo upgrade i can t remember when i first started noticing this it s possible it s been around longer and i only noticed recently now that a new member of the security group has started to help triage the incoming ,3

created attachment patch v for ldap c sdk this problem is seen in client programs that use ssl clientauth and that use different credentials client certificates on different connections to the same server during the same process lifetime it is also seen in programs that use clientauth on some connections to a server but not on other connections to the same server during the same process lifetime this is seen most commonly is test clients that are trying to simulate different users but it may also be seen in servers that are trying to replicate different data sets to a remote server with a different client credential for each different data set the problem is that after one connection has been established between the client and the server using some or no credential all subsequent connections to the same server may use the same credential or same absent credential even if the client has called ldapssl enable clientauth specifying different credentials to be used for each subsequent connection here is an explanation ssl remembers caches information about previously established sessions with remote clients and servers and reuses that information from old sessions whenever possible to minimize the expensive computational overhead of establishing new sessions with each new connection when a new connection is made if the server says let s reuse the session we last used then the most recent session from that socket s cache will be used even if that previous session was established using different credentials than the client now wishes to use nss s ssl client library supports the use of multiple separate named caches to allow the sessions associated with one set of credentials to be remembered separately from the sessions associated with other sets of credentials so a client program that uses credentials for alice with some sockets and uses credentials for bob with other sockets can have separate caches for alice and bob if the connections for alice are configured to use alice s cache and bob s connections use bob s cache all confusion over different credentials can be eliminated when a program or thread uses a socket for which it has not configured an explicitly named socket then nss uses a default unnamed cache for that socket there is only one default unnamed cache if multiple threads trying to act as separate users do not specify explicitly named caches for their respective users identities then the separate users will end up using a common set of credentials from the common cache resulting in confusion it may be reasonable for all ldap connections that do not use client auth to share a common cache because each connections that uses no client auth typically is re authenticated using some other method such as simple name and password authentication but it is not reasonable for client auth connections to share a cache with connections that use no client auth that is the problem experienced with the ldap c sdk the ldap c sdk never explicitly names a cache to be used with any ssl socket so all ssl sockets share the common unnamed cache with the resulting identity confusion a named cache is implicitly created the first time its name is configured to be used by a socket cache entries have a lifetime after which they expire when all the cache entries for a named cache have expired the cache disappears so it s very easy to use named caches you just give the name to the ssl socket before doing the first handshake on that socket and ssl does the rest i have attempted to modify the ldap c sdk to do that to configure each ssl socket that will be used with a client certificate to use a cache with the same name as the nickname of the cert to be used i have attached to this bug an untested patch that i believe will solve the problem i would like one of the ldap c sdk cognoscenti you know who you are to test this patch and see if it does indeed satisfactorily solve the problem for them ,2

problems you must always reencode the message to bit quoted printable prior signing as stated in rfc transfer encoding for signing using multipart signed if a multipart signed entity is ever to be transmitted over the standard internet smtp infrastructure or other transport that is constrained to bit text it must have transfer encoding applied so that it is represented as bit text mime entities that are bit data already need no transfer encoding entities such as bit text and binary data can be encoded with quoted printable or base transfer encoding for verifying mails have to be always encoded back to bit quoted printable prior verifying theoretically the mail within my sent folder bit signed should be invalid but it is not because you do not canonicalize the data before verifying which is an rfc violation too solution if the mail is bit reencode it to bit quoted printable before you sign if a signed mail is bit reencode it to bit quoted printable before you verify reproducible always steps to reproduce deactivated the setting edit preference mail newsgroups composition for messages that contain bit characters use quoted printable mime encoding and sign an email with smime

user agent mozilla windows u windows nt en us rv gecko firefox build identifier there is apparently an internal default timeout in thunderbird for imap operations after seconds if any particular imap operation has not completed thunderbird simply drops the imap connection re opens another one and immediately issues the same command again this is very bad behaviour on numerous counts i m not sure if the particular timeout encountered here is listed on this site but it might be http kb mozillazine org modify thunderbird settings for example one customer of ours is testing deleting large numbers of messages thunderbird by default does a message delete by actually copying the message to the trash folder then setting the delete flag on the messages in the original folder for example the inbox in doing this it is issuing imap copy instructions on a large range of messages in a single operation the imap protocol does not allow for any processing response mid transaction in this only ok no or bad upon completion termination of the operation if these operations take more than seconds to complete thunderbird simply gives up and issues the same command again over and over as the server may not even now at this point that the connection is dropped it may actually have multiple simultaneous copy or append operations initiated following is an example from a communigate pro log for a copy of messages to the mailbox inbox testmailbox notice the minute intervals imap inp uid copy inbox testmailbox imap inp uid copy inbox testmailbox imap inp uid copy inbox testmailbox there are probably a few recommended behavioural changes here imap has no timeouts defined at all in the protocol http www faqs org rfcs rfc html it would probably be better more correct to use timeouts only at the tcp level and not at the imap application layer since there is no support in imap to notify either party server client of timing if you really think that timeouts are needed the default ones should be increased significantly minutes or longer at a minimum however logically there will always be some operation which could be issued which would exceed whatever timeout was set imap copy or append operations can be very resource expensive and time consuming for obvious reasons modern mailboxes may be many gbs in size if a timeout is signaled the client should not simply issue the same command again as it can only make server performance degrade in this scenario it might be better if thunderbird performed a copy operation instead on each message rather than on ranges of messages this would increase the number of transactions but would ensure that each operation was acknowledged individually and would allow thunderbird to display to progression of messages being moved to the destination mailbox reproducible always steps to reproduce create a very large mailbox one in which performing an imap copy or append will take longer than seconds on the server to complete copy the messages in this mailbox to another mailbox or alternately just use the thunderbird delete operation which by default copies the messages to the trash mailbox in most cases the operation will never complete or thunderbird will lock up freeze actual results operation never completes successfully and the command may be automatically repeated indefinitely by thunderbird thereby potentially greatly increasing the load on the imap server expected results the imap copy or append should complete eventually this bug is probably related to many others i found in the database though none exactly laying out the underlying problem which is that the imap protocol does not provide for timeouts or mid transaction dialog therefore these timeouts should probably be removed from thunderbird here are some other bugs likely related https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id another optimization that could be made in this area though with more discussion really needed because of the change in behaviour is that the trash mailbox should really be a virtual mailbox listing all of those messages marked delete without actually having to perform an imap copy operation to a real mailbox called trash this is highly inefficient as a default behaviour note some users may prefer to have an actual trash mailbox as a storage space so this behaviour could be retained as an option thank you very much please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or need more information ,2

user agent build identifier mozilla windows u windows nt de at rv gecko mozilla doesn t launch helper applications if they are defined for executable files in the latest builds it was possible in older versions without problems i use an helper application to prevent an not very experienced user from executing and saving applications by setting an helper application for executable files that simply displays a dialog you are not allowed to do this adds the file to a logfile and kills it then i ve setted editable to false for this dangerous mime types in mimetypes rdf this successfully protected this user from executing any malware so far no this save dialog reduces the security in this scenario since this user is now able to save the file to somewhere and open it another useful application area for helper applications for executable files would be an script that automatically passes the file to an virus scanner and then decides if this file gets saved to the download directory or if the file gets deleted i ve found out that this is caused by an patch for fixing the following bug http bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id i completely agree that it s needed to block the automatich execution of executables from mozilla disabling use default action for this type of file but i don t agree that it s needed to make it impossible to set helper applications for them if you don t want to make it possible to set helper applications for executables per default then i think there should be at least an hidden setting to make it possible to enable this via user js reproducible always steps to reproduce set an new helper application for application octet stream for example open with notepad exe add an exe file of your choice to an compose mail window and choose send later from the file menu go to your unsend messages open the unsend mail and doubleclick the attachment actual results i get the save file dialog even if i ve setted an helper application for this mime type expected results mozilla should have executed the helper application ,2

first some background as provided to me by the ever helpful attinasi cssframeconstructor attributechanged is called this is were the restyling happens first the content object is asked what the impact of the change is given an attribute and a value it can indicate a reconstruction a reframe or a simple visual change for reconstruct the entire document is torn down and rebuilt pretty harsh for a reframe a new frame is created for the affected content and normal frame construction style resolution takes place for a visual change we ask the framemanager to compute the style change impact this walks up the frames getting the style contexts from them and re resolves the style on each one reresolve style runs through all of the style rules for the content and any pseudo style associated with it and sets the new style values as it goes it checks if the style context actually changes and if it does it appends the new context to a list of changes it also keeps track of the kinds of changes that are made indicating if there needs to be a reflow a reframe or just a repaint depending on the results of the resolutions we then either reconstruct the frames issue a reflow or update paint the views end of attinasi missive so this means that the best case scenario for an attribute change is that we walk every frame in the document and reresolve the style on each one then we decide what to do with it and in the best case again we do nothing or issue a paint i guess as an example of why i really want to fix this behaviour scrolling a gfx scrollbar sets the curpos attribute lots like lots and lots so i hacked up a patch which i will attach below it keeps a list on each style sheet of each attribute that actually appears in a selector and then checks against that table when an attribute changes only if that attribute can affect style context do we do the re resolve dance with this patch i spit out a for each style reresolution that i manage to skip and a for each one that has to happen anyway no attribute involved in the reresolution or attribute that mattered i scrolled the checkin rules page down and then back up and got the following so damn it looks like we can win pretty huge here but of course it s not quite that easy i m apparently causing not quite enough action in the layout engine at times because some needed updates aren t happening as an example while the document scrolls the scroll thumb doesn t move and image rollovers as found on my old nemesis http www honda com don t work maybe i need to fire a paint at the minimum maybe i m blocking reresolutions too aggressively and need to be more careful that i only block the ones that are directly from the attributechanged notification and not from other paths through that code i m not sure yet but i wanted to throw this out for people to poke at while i ponder i think the patch will build but some files did get touched lightly when i updated before the diff and there are some other unrelated i think changes in my layout tree no warranty express or implied ,2

emails from smfr one problem that i can see in the menu code is that keep a ref to gdefaultrootmenu around which just happens to be the first menubar we create however if that menubar gets destroyed then we delete all its menu items the nsmenu code releases its menurefs but we don t remove those deleted menurefs from their parent menu bar in addition it seems that the parent menu is not holding refs to submenus as you might expect so the garbage that i am seeing on is related to the setrootmenu gdefaultrootmenu on a root menu whose submenus have been deleted but not removed from their parent menubar i verified this by inserting a new dummy menu into this menu bar one thing i think we should definately fix is that the dtor for nsmenux should remove its menuref from the parent menubar right now that doesn t happen this is seen more often with non jar builds which smfr runs bless his heart since there appears to be a race condition with which menubar hidden window or nav window gets loaded first it s all good if the hidden window loads first but if the nav window does we get garbage as the menu is populated with bad menurefs ,2

with the following html the table is rendered as if a zero table width were specified http doc weblogs com is the site where i noticed this issue i won t pretend to be enough of a standards wonk to say whether this is strictly wrong but it appears to be inconsistent with netscape and internet explorer if you remove the width from the table element the text renders on one line with it there it only renders as wide as the widest word test this is a simple test ,0
at this and some other pages the pages have a fixed width intentionally or otherwise which makes them impossible to resize downward past a certain point this certain point is too wide for the default window width in macos even under x in mozilla and probably in most all other browsers and would be too wide for probably any os browser under x or smaller the end result is that users are either forced to resize the window if they can or to side scroll annoyedly pages should never be given a fixed width intentionally unless extensive platform and monitor mode detection takes place and a custom version of the page is provided based on that data care should be taken to prevent accidental fixture of the window width at an unnecessarily wide point e g by overly wide banners form entry fields long unbroken text strings etc ,1

this bug describes a design change that i ve been talking about for a while see various posts to mozilla layout many bugs likely to be fixed by this change have reflow refactor in the status whiteboard i ve been working on the changes on various reflow yyyymmdd branch branches the basic idea to make two closely related changes at the same time change intrinsic width computation so that it happens in separate methods on nsiframe currently preferred with calculation using the nsiframe api can happen in two different ways as well having only one codepath reduces incremental layout inc bugs change the way we handle incremental layout to use dirty bits on the frames rather than the reflow tree which is essentially out of line dirty bits and a complicated system of reflow reasons that often leads to weird incremental layout inc bugs i hope to add more details of the new design here in the near future much of it is still open to change at this point the branch is close to compiling and probably a ways from working so the cost of changing things is still relatively low ,2

currently we have several people flagged as editors who are reviewing on the preview site which will become real amo but we have not established a review policy for remora i suspect that currently editors are treating push to public as approve and retain in sandbox as deny in other words unless there is something wrong with an add on it is getting pushed to public which is not how the system was designed to be used also all reviews the comment kind are moderated by default but editors have been given no instructions as to what kind of reviews should be approved users will assume they are the same as in v i think we need to stop all reviews until this policy is established otherwise we will be treating add ons submitted after the policy is created unfairly this needs to be taken care of asap because we probably do want reviews to continue before the launch ,4

this bug was originally reported by kai engert in bug comment he reports that he called cert pkixverifycert passing it a set of one or more certificates to be used as explicit trust anchors and a policy oid and a cert from a particular server he expected the function call to either a succeed and return a chain that was anchored by one of the roots he supplied or b fail instead he reports that it succeeded but the root ca cert that it returned as being the matching trust anchor was not one of the certs he had passed in to the call but rather was one of nss s built in trusted root certs so it appears that nss did not use the caller supplied list of anchors to the exclusion of all the other usual trust anchors but merely in addition to the usual trust anchors this is bad news for ev i think we should try to reproduce this with vfychain or vfyserv i will attempt to attach to this bug a zip file containing the certs sent by the server in the tls handshake i don t know exactly how many root ca certs kai passed to cert pkixverifycert but i believe that one of them was the cert found at http crt comodoca com comodocertificationauthority crt and the ev policy oid used with it was kai can you tell us if there were any other certs passed as trust anchors ,2

cannot use bouncer to server mar files the incremental downloader cannot handle http redirects the problem is that when nshttpchannel cpp follows a redirect it does not propogate any user defined headers in this case it is the range header that is so crucial without it we get a response which triggers bug an easy solution would be to intercept onchannelredirect and then add the range header on the newly created channel it might also make sense to just make nshttpchannel cpp do this by default since this problem also likely impacts the adobe acrobat plugin as well as xmlhttprequest consumers that need to set request headers ,4

summary the threadpool optimistically kills worker threads as soon as the total number of threads is greater than the minimun limit the file transport uses the thread pool for its worker threads during startup there is an exceptional ammount of file transport activity for every file that is loaded in there must exist a worker thread in the threadpool the file transport sets min and max number for the number of threads the current logic in the threadpool is that it will spawn new thread for all requests up to the limit when the worker thread when finished will check to see if there are any pending requests if there are none and there are more threads in the threadpool than the set lower limit the thread immeditely exits because of this algorithm there is alot of turnover in that pool the file transport could just raise the lower limit so that there are more persistant threads however this would just add to bloat since these extra thread are primarly needed for startup another better solution would be to include a delay so that we can catch any additional request that may come in for example from a normal startup to ftp ftp netscape com org there are new threads created and threads deleted this is completely insane after putting a second wait there are only new threads created and deleted this removes thread creation deletions going to http www mozilla org creates threads adding a second delay reduces this to creating only threads clearly there should be some period of wait time before the thread exist so that we don t get a huge number of thread exits followed by an immeditate start i am not sure exactly what this will trim off of startup time i ran some basic timing tests on a p dual windows k mb ram it take only ms to create threads however this is not a accurate picture since creation of a thread doesn t really do much but schedules it i also looked at how long it takes from the creation of a thread to its actual running the data indicates that it takes longer as there are more threads with threads present it takes on average milliseconds from the time pr createthread is called to the time the user defined function is entered and does a printf maybe somebody here has better knowledge of thread startup preformance attached in my proposed change ,2

for app update instead of downloading standard xpis firefox is attempting to install via xpi wrapped native installer smaller size for one running firefox launches the installer puts entry in xpicleanup dat to get rid of the installer exe eventually scenario i if you leave firefox running the installer eventually gets to a point where it asks you to click ok to shut down firefox if you click the ok button to shut it down comes up twice see bug then firefox shuts down apparently without launching xpicleanup exe on the side the shutdown code attempts to pass the kill option to shut down turbo mode neither of which is supported by firefox a new browser window opens instead which is a bit counter productive if you re trying to shut it down simply need to remove the turbo killing lines from check instance in config ini at the end of the install the new firefox is launched it notices the entry in xpicleanup dat gives a shut down restart message and launches xpicleanup exe you should be able to restart firefox now it s just a bit ugly getting here scenario ii as above but instead of letting the installer kill firefox shut it down cleanly xpicleanup exe is launched to deal with the installer entry in xpicleanup dat but because the installer is still running it hangs around trying every polling interval during the install it finds xpicleanup exe is in use so another entry is made in xpicleanup dat to finish installing that when the install is over i don t think the installer launches another copy of xpicleanup exe at the end though at this point the xpi script should have returned a status code to the native installer because the xpicleanup exe hangup means it couldn t complete and the native installer should have put up a message about needing to restart to complete the install not seeing that in firefox at the end you launch firefox which gives the incomplete install message because xpicleanup dat exists it launches another copy of xpicleanup exe the installer goes away so that part of the cleanup can be accomplished but xpicleanup can t delete itself so it just hangs around never able to finish at this point it should have put a startup entry in the windows registry if you reboot everything gets straightened out but if you keep starting firefox you just get the message and more copies of xpicleanup exe all waiting for each other to die scenario ii is uglier than scenario i ,2

not sure exactly who to give this to so i m cc ing some layout heavy hitters and assigning it to myself this bug was originally reported as bug composer crashes when loading pages with an html select element framemanager getprimaryframefor for which i checked in a work around the basic problem is that nsstylechangelist appendchange does not deal with the fact that anonymous frames can point to either an anonymous content node or the content node for a parent frame should two or more sibling anonymous content frames require a frame change we can get into trouble if we push an anonymous content node on the changelist and then push the parent content node on the list as the result of a sibling frame who s content pointer pointed to the parent content node nscssframeconstructor processrestyledframes processes the changelist backwards which means it would process the parent content node first so as a result we end up blowing away the entire frame hierarchy including the anonymous content frames and all their anonymous content leaving deleted nodes in the change list that will be processed when they do get processed we usually crash some place like getprimaryframefor i ll attatch a js test case that demostrates this crash rather easily in the browser and viewer it s probably a good idea to read over the comments dbaron and i made in bug for more details a stack trace for the crash looks something like this framemanager getprimaryframefor framemanager const x d e nsicontent x ab b nsiframe x ccec line bytes presshell getprimaryframefor const presshell const x

mozilla needs to remove all support for username and password authentication in the url from http https and http with ssl this problematic feature allows urls in the form of http username password example com currently when mozilla gets that url it takes the user to example com and logs the user in as username with password unfortunately this can be exploited indeed it has grown increasingly common that urls in the form of http username password example com are creating large security problems take this example http www mozilla org item dq d h nf dhdfjk jk d djk example com bad evil fraud identitytheft following that url a user might think he is going to the friendly confines of mozilla org unfortunately he ends up at the unfriendly confines of http example com bad evil fraud identitytheft this feature is being used today to harm and exploit our users we have to respond mozilla has made improvements in our handling of these urls further improvements are on the drawing board neverthless any improvements ultimately cannot raise our level of security high enough we can try to fashion a dialog box or even highlight the url in an eye catching manner user education must accompany any such enhancement of course the internet will always have many new inexperienced and uneducated users even experienced users sometimes click on the wrong urls by accident therefore it is inevitable that many mozilla users will be exploited by this feature no matter how we improve on it the only way to really solve the problem once and for all is to rip out url authentication altogether rfc may indeed require that an http s implementation like mozilla honor url authentication http www faqs org rfcs rfc html allowing these kinds of urls was fine a few years ago today however it creates a security hole ever more commonly exploited the mozilla project does need to honor standards yet when the purpose of a certain standard is no longer relevant or is outweighed by other concerns such as security then we have to react to the changing real world conditions today the cost of supporting this feature far outweighs the benefit by removing this feature we will fix a major security hole for good microsoft has announced it will remove support for these urls http support microsoft com default aspx scid kb ln since msie currently has an market share most sites that make use of this feature will soon give it up thus when mozilla follows suit and removes the feature our userbase will not be terribly aggrieved neither ftp nor any other protocol is affected by this bug report ,2

for pages having alternate stylesheets but where there is no base stylesheet eg a lack of a stylesheet without a title attribute the style sheet selector does not display no theme but instead only displays basic theme along with the titles of the other themes on that page this is incorrect such pages do not have a base or basic theme style to speak of moreover selecting basic theme does what no theme usually does completely strips all styling from the page whereas on pages with both no theme and basic theme the latter just strips the styling of the alternate stylesheets but not that of the untitled base theme at present asa s blog is an example of such a page i m also going to attach a pair of test cases ,1

in build pgo automation py in there s this class process represents a subprocess of this process we don t just directly use the subprocess module here because we want compatibility with python on non windows platforms subprocess isn t included in the python standard library but it is compatible with python and even all we need to do is hg add a copy of subprocess py with a different name and conditionally import that might not be worth it although it does look like process would tend to create zombie processes when exceptions happen filing for good luck ,1

when speculative script parsing bug landed we started seeing intermittent orange on the talos boxes due to crashes during tp eventually i disabled speculative parsing so that the trees would be green for beta however it would be nice to re enable speculative parsing the problem is that it isn t at all clear why the talos boxes are crashing as far as i know nobody reported any speculative parsing related crashes or was able to reproduce the crashiness i did try to install standalone talos however i was unable to reproduce the crash with the regular pageset and installing the full pageset into my standalone talos caused it to not work at all as far as i could tell the browser refused to start at all becoming a defunct process immediately i was able to hack something up to run through the pageset but after cycles across machines i crashed only once in seemingly unrelated code it would be really nice if i could get some sort of crash stack for the crashes that talos is seeing so i could direct my debugging efforts directly at the problems that talos is running into instead of staring at the code trying to come up with any possible problem if you need any other information please ask ,2

user agent mozilla windows u windows nt en us rv gecko firefox build identifier mozilla windows u windows nt en us rv gecko firefox when i go to bugzilla to report a bug in either firefox or mozilla search results window defaulting to top when window initially displayed is squished under firefox it s only enough to display line summaries of bugs and is about cm high under opera and ie the window displays and bugs respectively and have vertical heights of about and cm respectively the dpi is set the same in all three browsers this makes perusal of the buglist difficult and frankly dissuades me from looking at very many bugs for duplicates maybe whatever is in the first scrolls on each browser or about bugs on ff why is this window so darn small on ff it s weird that ff can t display full bug result window on its own bug manager but opera and ie can display full size windows of nearly same height theoretically i believe ff s window should be of similar height since the screen size is constant on all and the dpi is constant on all so whether or not it computes a window height based on an absolute height say cm high or a percent of screen height or percent of window height windows are all roughly same height slightly smaller than screen height they should be in same ball park but ff s windows are about fifth the height of the other two browsers i can t imagine this problem is limited to ff but i don t do side by sides on every webpage this example is especially in my face because it s the main entry for entering ff and tb bugs slightly tangential suggestion maybe ff needs to do a bug fix and code cleanup only release maybe a redesign of code structure toward more optimality assuming anyone has thought of more optimal structures if not nevermind on that it s just that i notice in many projects that features keep getting added on and at some point due to the way the code has developed a different structure organization works better smaller faster cleaner more internal orthogonality less overlap duplication etc only reason i side comment is that sometimes bugs like this just fall out disappear as a side effect of a code cleanup it may be the case that something in the code has systemically caused size problems due to a some programming model that doesn t quite fit the problem space the slightly odd fit might not have been a problem before but as a project expands a slight misfit can grow into noticeable problem a bit like a small pebble in a shoe feeling like a boulder after walking several miles reproducible always steps to reproduce i don t know that any specific steps are required i ve haven t seen it work correctly since the shift to ff i believe actual results small window gives portal sized view of ocean s worth of data expected results large window taking up large percentage of screen to allow me to view many bugs at one glance without having to scroll since scrolling uses mouse and rsi problems make me mouse typing conservative i believe this has been present since shift to though for sure since incorrect sizing of this window is a major problem on this page and i believe may be an expression of other size issues in the code where it doesn t scale output widgets in accordance with text scaling though in this specific case the problem appears to be exacerbated well beyond what is commonly the effect of text widget scaling inconsistencies ,1

created attachment patch var stream create an empty storage stream somehow stream getoutputstream write foo stream getinputstream throws exception the above code fails for a couple reasons most obviously and second the uninitialization of segment buffers when the storage stream contains bytes either with no writes or with an explicit write after the first condition is changed this patch fixes this so that you can get an input stream for a storage stream whenever the given position is less than or equal to the amount of data in the stream so long as data has been written explicitly even if the amount of data written was bytes it does not allow a getoutputstream immediately followed by a getinputstream which i attempted to implement but finally abandoned as more trouble than it was worth and more than likely behavior the author would consider a bug note that there is a use case for writing and then getting an inputstream from position see the url field ,1

freebsd x has a bug in its implementation of dlopen if the same c symbol is exported from multiple libraries opened with dlopen every library picks up the version of the symbol present in the first library opened with dlopen see for details on this freebsd bug this bug naturally wreaks havoc on mozilla components both bug and bug seem to have been due to it though in each case it s been specifically fixed or perhaps worked around by declaring offending symbols static however there is enough copy pasted code in mozilla that tracking down every multiply defined symbol seems an impossible task i don t currently have any specific behavioral bugs that can be tracked to this though now that these two bugs have been fixed so qa can probably take a break on this one the behavior of dlopen has been changed in freebsd current i think this is why neither of the above two bugs were apparently present on current machines the correct workaround for this bug i think is to force mozilla to be compiled with enable low fat on freebsd this flag strips all symbols except the four that are required for components and are opened with dlsym from the component binaries note that on freebsd versions prior to or current you ll want to apply the fix described in bug to enable low fat or dlopen will spew huge amounts of debugging information ,2

n b most people don t use builds with the code that this bug is complaining about it s not enabled in release builds since disable gnomeui defaults to doing a configure test for the version and the build machines don t currently have that version although that could change in the future but it does show up in builds that people do on relatively new distributions the gnome icon code in modules libpr n decoders icon gtk is really really slow i ve described this on irc in the past and some people had useful suggestions on my machine it takes a few hundred milliseconds per icon this is a significant slowdown just when opening a dialog that has ok and cancel buttons since we do two such icon loads in that case at least the first time but it s a much much more serious problem for bookmarks where we do an icon load for every single file url in any displayed bookmarks if a bookmarks folder or the personal toolbar has a lot of file urls in it this is a huge slowdown and can lead to multi second delays waiting for bookmarks menus to open using some printf timing since profiling of things involving x server etc can be a little unreliable the slowest pieces of nsiconchannel initwithgnome seem to be the call to gnome icon lookup typically around ms the g object unref of the icon theme odd typically around ms the pixmap manipulation from there to the end of the function varies a lot sometimes it s almost instantaneous sometimes it s near ms sometimes in between when i brought this up on irc a bunch of people had suggestions for improving the last part but that s actually not the bulk of the time i don t think mozilla should ship this code in official builds until these problems are resolved ,2
created attachment patch v the code that defines nss libs and nss dep libs in configure in uses continuation lines in the variable definition that is later used in an ac subst this is not allowed because the build system splits the sed script used to process all the ac subst s at line boundaries which could end up being in the middle of a continuation line the current situation is that adding any ac subst before the ones for nss libs and nss dep libs will result in a very difficult to figure out build failure this issue is currently preventing the code for bug which is targeted for beta from landing ,4

taken from http bugscape mcom com show bug cgi id gecko currently creates a custom palette and selects it as the foreground palette this causes two problems if an embedding application has a foreground palette it will get into a race condition with gecko where they are both trying to select the foreground palette resulting if flickering and hanging the application when a separate application with a foreground palette is activated the colors in the gecko browser window will be messed up because its palette has been swapped out ,3

spun off of bug wherein several of us wanted to clone to you know clone a bug rather than dropping you back to the product chooser every time you wanted to clone a bug bugzilla devs indicate that requiring you to choose a product every time you want to clone a bug is the intended behavior from bug comment my definition of clone includes retaining the classification product component and assignee qa the reason i make a clone is so that i don t have to search for the product component assignee qa if i wanted to file a new bug i d have gone off and filed a new bug the cloning we use involves changing basically a flag which basically indicates a different branch steps file a bug in foopy newpie boopy against assi yippie qa darpy with summary peppy and comment hipp hipp horrip click clone expected results bug is prefilled with foopy newpie boopy against assi yippie qa darpy with summary peppy and comment hipp hipp horrip actual results in a heavily customized bugzilla product chooser from bug comment yes i would expect clone to keep the component etc that s the hardest part to fill out my use case was that i needed to file a new bug for a similar task and wasn t sure how to fill it out i found an old one that was correct and hit clone if someone wants to file in a different component i think it s just as trivial to change component as it is to pick one from scratch there are other comments in bug from users of other bugzillas indicating other reasons why having clone clone without requiring a trip to the product chooser is desirable but i ve just copied these two from regular bmo users the good people at eclipse have attached a patch to bug attachment that makes clone behave sanely since there is a patch there filing this bug against bmo to see about taking a local customization to fix cloning ,1

the patch i ll attach fixes everything found by find iname html tmpl xargs gmuck mode html nodeprecated nomimetype with one exception the exception is that the edit comment as text doesn t have a rows attribute which is required we set the size using a style attribute mozilla seems to ignore the rows attribute but i need to check if that is guarenteed that page only wokrs in mozilla atm so i m not worried about other browsers the mimetype warnings are all on the fact that we use text javascript instead of application x javascript was this a deliberate decision made for old ie versions or something if not i ll fix those too this is for not although the account email confirm html tmpl part may need to go into since i can imagine browsers having issues with that most of the fixes are obvious adding action attribute to s and alt to and so on those that aren t include global useful links html tmpl gmuck warns about inconcistant quote style so i changed these to use instead of they were because of how we were quoting for tt search form html tmpl gmuck picked up on note the tag is unclosed at the end of this template as not having an action attribute since the opening isn t in this template and only one template uses this particular template i think its a fairly silly comment so i removed it i care because i want gmuck to become part of the tests see bug i thought about reporting this as a gmuck bug but its not since gmuck shouldn t be expected to know about tt s comment scheme ,1

the bayesian filter tokenizer currently sees headers that are set by mailnews itself such as the keywords header this causes some strange feedback effects particularly in the case of applying soft tags since the existance of the keyword itself is obviously a very strong indicator for soft tagging with that header then whether the header is present or not has a strong effect on the calculated trait match percent this causes after the fact trait bayesian percentage calculations to differ dramatically in some cases from the cases where the filter is applied during normal message reciept which is very confusing it is actually worse than that the most common time when you train with a keyword applied is when you are correcting a false positive in that case the presence of the keyword in the message is an anti indicator of the need for the keyword this causes an oscillation in values as the keyword is removed if present or placed if absent on subsequent after the fact calculations i need to decide whether to hard wire the tokenizer to ignore headers set by mailnews itself or implement some sort of interface to allow extensions to manipulate the tokenizer ,1

user agent mozilla compatible msie windows nt q net clr build identifier mozilla the mozilla sdk client occasionally ignores requests when the ldap server returns more than one referral with a little logging and tracing i find that some requests terminate parent requests before the parent completes receiving responses this results in lost entry results and even lost referrals in read msg of result c a while loop decreases the lr outrefcnt of the parent associated with the finished referral below the loop finishes with lr pointing to the highest parent who has a positive lr outrefcnt after the subtraction or simply the highest parent in the branch in either case read msg continues and frees everything at lr and below with nsldapi free request lr so the while loop had better give us the highest completed lr or it will free outstanding requests unfortunately my logs show that the while loop can finish with an lr above requests who still have lr res msgtype ldap res search reference indicating that indeed the current code incorrectly frees outstanding requests typically how does this happen consider a system where referral generates requests looking like r r r where arrows children assume r just got a final response from the server setting its lr res msgtype to ldap res search result and read msg now enters the while loop the loop goes up to r to decrease its lr outrefcnt to what if r isn t done what if it is about to receive an entry or another url referral what if r s lr res msgtype ldap res search reference right now the while loop ignores it the loop only sees r s lr outrefcnt and continues up to set lr r assume r already has lr res msgtype ldap res search reference remember responses from the server arrive any time so although r is incomplete r may have completed ages ago since r was r s only referral r s lr outrefcnt is now the while loop can t go up further and lets lr rest at r when we get to the we recognize a request as complete when conditions we see that r satisfies all conditions satisfying these conditions we enter the resource freeing code when nsldapi free request lr starts freeing resources from the r branch r disappears though it s not finished what can we do to stop this calamity placing an lr res msgtype check before traversing up to the parent can correct this all we have to do is stop at r and r will fail the conditions that are required to execute nsldapi free request lr to stop at r we immediately break the loop when lr res msgtype ldap res search reference in the while loop right after merge error info before lr lr lr parent traverses up when we finally get a result response for r we ll execute this loop again and this time lr lr res msgtype should be ldap res search result which will let us continue and free r properly note that we subtract the parent s lr outrefcnt at the end of the previous iteration of the same while loop so its lr outrefcnt is always current even with the new loop breaker the fix looks like while lr lr parent null merge error info ld lr lr parent lr if lr lr res msgtype ldap res search reference new break new lr lr lr parent if lr lr outrefcnt break reproducible always steps to reproduce set up three server instances a b c set up referrals a b c execute any sub search from a that must refer to b then c repeat step until symptoms surface and an expected entry cannot be found actual results after about an hour of looping entry in the directory cannot be found ldap success returns as if no entries were expected executing one more search for the same entry reveals it indeed should ve have been found it seems the faster the computer the longer it takes for the symptoms to appear expected results returned the entry from the directory consistantly test done with netscape directory server on an hp ux system with the september quality pack ,3

user agent mozilla x u linux i en us rv gecko ubuntu hardy firefox build identifier running the tests with ant junit all reports a lot of failed tests running tests as explained at https developer mozilla org en running the rhino tests doesn t report any failure at least for interpreted mode this shows that there is a big problem at least in one of the two methods the first failing test reported when running the tests as junit tests is lc arraymethods object js which is not reported as failing by jsdriver if i add following as first statement of jsdriver excluded if path contains lc arraymethods object js return true and run jsdriver tests again then only this single test is run and if fails exactly like when running it as unit test for me this shows a really big problem in the tests particularly this seems to mean that we can t trust the results of jsdriver and that the unit test result are more correct in which case a lot of tests fail currently additionally do we really need jsdriver it is important to be able to build and run the tests in automatic build process and have usable results that we can trust junit seems better suited for this purpose i set the severity of this issue as critical because i think that we can t have any reliable information on rhino s quality as long as it is not fixed reproducible always steps to reproduce ,3

two bugs have already been filed on this issue bug and bug unfortunately while the patches on both were reviewed and approved neither one actually works with the latest patch from bug applied i get the following output from checksetup pl fixing indexes and uniqueness dbd mysql st execute failed you have an error in your sql syntax near primary at line at checksetup pl line dbd mysql st fetchrow arrayref failed you have an error in your sql syntax near primary at line at checksetup pl line the reason for this is that dropindexes makes no allowance for the idea that it may ever have to drop a primary key to do so requires this syntax alter table milestones drop primary key perusal of the code in dropindexes shows that it can only produce the following syntax alter table milestones drop index primary there are two approaches to fixing this either fix dropindexes so that it handles primary key drops properly or just add the above line with the correct syntax in place of the dropindexes call the former is better the latter is faster and at this particular moment with release so near speed may be more important ,2

it is possible to implement an aria grid or treegrid using css positioning instead of an html underneath right now we only support the accessible table interfaces if a real is actually used unfortunately this may be quite difficult to implement we either need to allow an nsaccessible to qi to nsiaccessibletable but only when the appropriate role is attached or we need to create a new type of object when grid or treegrid is used i think is probably okay since a table should not also be a text hypertext editabletext or anything else in that case it s perhaps not too difficult to manage however since it is possible to do things with an html table i won t call this a priority for firefox ,2

here s a set of patches that allows the nss release to be compiled on bsd os the first several of the patches are pretty straightforward the patches to security nss cmd platlibs mk have a comment in them saying they are a hack and indeed they are the problem they work around is having a reference to pr assert in the libnss so library this happens because the libnss so library is always built with ddebug it should be built like the nspr library and honor the user s settings for debug non debug versions of the build the inclusion of libswft on the link lines allows the utilities to build because libswft has a stub reference to pr assert in it i m not exactly sure why i had to make the patch to security nss lib freebl mpi mpi c it looks like max digit is undefined coming into that piece of code line stubbing out the offending preprocessor line works around the problem the patch to security nss lib ssl unix err c is a lame workaround for the unconditional inclusion of the poll h file which should not be done on all platforms i would claim that the problem lies in the unconditional inclusion of this file finally there is a patch which will create the mozilla security coreconf bsd os mk file which is needed until autoconf rules the land to get the nss library to build on bsd os thanks for your attention kurt,3

idn processing is defined to only use characters in the unicode repertoire however at least one character u hangul jungseong filler first defined in unicode can be shown to pass straight through the idn name preparation logic as in this example www python info is translated to www xn python eyy info instead of being blocked as an invalid idn although this character has dodgy space like rendering in the current mozilla rendering code and is therefore a display spoofing risk it is neither ignored nor prohibited in the current nameprep rules designed to prevent these problems since the ignore exclude lists in nameprep do not address characters not in unicode fortunately this particular character is currently caught be the hand rolled ad hoc idn dodgy display character blacklist and is displayed as punycode however it would be better if the idn code was strictly rfc compliant with regard to characters not in unicode and that this name was thus treated as invalid during the idn processing removing the need to catch it as a special case at display time although this particular case is not a serious security problem in itself it does suggest that the current idn processing code is still not watertight and therefore that there may be other unknown idn spoofing or other security problems lurking which are still not addressed by the current code ,2

notes moved from bugscape with branch the following html page works properly on any browsers including standalone mozilla but not on embedded gecko it was our last minute beta stopper var popup window open about blankpopup width height resizable var d popup document d write d write this is your titlehelloo d close hello additional comments from eddie xu created an attachment id a test case additional comments from lisa chiang cc marek qa to mdunn mike pls see if there is any bugzilla bugs filed on this already additional comments from eddie xu more research info it is not the document reference not working the problem is the returned popup window reference another weird thing is that if you do a reload without closing the popup window it will work so my doubt is that at the moment window open returns it is still in the middle of creating the docshell and hense the window reference is not valid additional comments from marek z jeziorek rick i m not sure if adam is available soon due to the time zones would you be able to investigate more before adam is involved with this thanks additional comments from adam lock i am here for an hour or so my initial investigation makes me think this some kind of race condition if i modify the test case to wait seconds before writing it works modified version follows additional comments from adam lock created an attachment id modified test case succeeds additional comments from adam lock modified version is as below var popup window open about blankpopup width height resizable settimeout splurge function splurge var d popup document d write d write this is your titlehelloo d close hello additional comments from eddie xu i am pretty sure we don t have this problem before but not sure how long ago at that time popup window did not render about blank initially i used to test stuff like popup window open http www yahoo com popup resizeto and it used to work it doesn t anymore additional comments from adam lock eddie window methods should work immediately but the window document property won t work until the document viewer has been created and associated with the window and the document viewer won t be created until the uriloader tells the docshell s content listener that there is some content to render this minor gap between the window opening and the document viewer being present perhaps we could make process atomic for about blank or wait in window open for the first content to arrive before returning ideas additional comments from eddie xu the two lines popup window open http www yahoo com popup resizeto is the exact codes i tested and it does not work unfortunately i can not block inside nsiembeddingsitewindow createbrowserwindow and peek for document viewer because it will never be created before i return from createbrowserwindow additional comments from rick potts hey eddie i ve spent some time tracing through both your cases popup document and popup resizeto and it turns out that they are related in the popup document case it is just as adam described no document is available because nothing has loaded yet in the popup resizeto case things are a bit more funny it is basically failing for the same reason no document however in this situation it is the security manager that is causing the failure basically it is trying to verify that you have the right to call resizeto unfortunately since no document is available it cannot locate a principal this causes it to silently fail the funny part is that there is only a small window of time when you are allowed to call resizeto it will only succeed if it is called after about blank has loaded but before http www yahoo com this is due to security restrictions the bottom line is that when ever you create a new browser window you need to create a nested message pump and block until the initial document probably about blank has been loaded into the webbrowser you can take a look at how mozilla does it at http lxr mozilla org seamonkey source xpfe appshell src nsxulwindow cpp as you also noticed mfcembed does not do the right thing either when creating new windows or with modality in general i ll see if we can fix up mfcebbed to do the right thing as a simpler example rick additional comments from eddie xu thanks adam does fix the painting problem but not the dom in your test case the one with settimeout splurge if we change window open about blank to window open like most site does your example won t work either so this is what i am going to try on the embedding side after a popup window is created i am going to explicitly load about blank and do a message pump and wait for the first onstatechange network done to come in the new window before i return from createbrowserwindow sounds like a right direction to go hi eddie the loading about blank thing was a workaround while we sorted painting problems in new windows for bugscape this now appears to be fixed so i don t believe you need to do it anymore adam additional comments from eddie xu hmm my initial try failed seems like if i do not return from createbrowserwindow the doc loading on the new window will never get completed here is the codes static void waitfordocshellready cgbrowser pnewbrowser cgbrowser pnewbrowser nscomptr piwebnav if piwebnav do queryinterface pnewbrowser m piwebbrowser cwebbrowsercontainer pwebcontainer

i was reading sun s report on gnome usability specifically this page and found that after a few minutes some of the graphics had not been downloaded this problem also affects other pages where downloads of large amounts of graphics can lead to timing out of page element downloads the only way i knew the download had effectively stopped was by looking at my modem lights several years experience of the internet has taught me that if after two or three minutes of inactivity the action on a computer is likely to have been aborted even if the computer has not told me we need to tell the user that this is the case in mozilla the exact circumstances the user has begun downloading a web page that included external elements commonly graphics some pages are slow to download for a variety of reasons and some fail to load completely what the user thinks the user may have begun reading the page s content or interacting with it perhaps there are no immediate signs that the web browser has not completed it s downloading process or perhaps an error has occured which has failed to inform the user or not triggered an appropriate event in the software either way the user is either aware of the problem or not in both cases the user has had no direct feedback from mozilla what needs to happen mozilla needs to inform the user as to exactly what it s doing and if it has reached a conclusion tell the user in this case mozilla has completed downloading x y components on the page a simple counting process that isn t displayed and it is unknown what it is attempting to do now if the network connection for the remaining components has timed out or concluded in an error which is apparently the case then the status bar should notify the user appropriately a suggestion is made below document done x xxx secs page could not be fully downloaded this tells the user that the document was rendered as best as could be acheived but that parts of the page were not successfully downloaded once this or other appropriate message has been displayed the throbber should terminte animation the stop button should deactivate and the reload button should be re activatable this bug should only cover the case whereby a page could be displayed but not fully downloaded feedback given when a page tries to execute instructions in a script and is in error are similar but should be covered in a seperate bug cc gordon darin from networking component as code hooks will be needed remove from cc list as appropriate ,1

build is from the morning of apr for some dialogs in mail news including the password dialog for my imap account and the dialog for an ssl warning come up too small to include all of the content in the case of the password dialog it means that the right side of the text area and text are cut off in the case of the ssl warning dialog none of the buttons are visible so i can never accept the warning to read my mail danm and i think that this is because the onload event is firing too early before all of the content has been loaded so the sizetocontent doesn t work correctly i filed this against xp toolkit widgets since i m not sure exactly where the problem is ,2

created attachment patch v while using a debug build you ll see occasional console messages like bit length overflow code bits these are a side effect of bug we reencode favicons as pngs the png encoder uses zlib and zlib barfs up messages like this now and then the messages are harmless but can be a bit confusing to people watching the console while testing their own changes this patch disables debug mode in zlib unless zlib debug is also defined zlib is extremely stable so there s not much value in having it s debug mode just because mozilla might be in debug too ,1
in the naive conversion from flat files to sql queries for more queries are used than are needed for example we should make sure that one query is used to get all the languages and other information on the main page rather than one to get the languages and one per language for the other information the largest offenders are the current rights draft implementation see bug and quickstats ,2
i thought that we had fixed this at one point but it seems to have been resurrected with the fix of bug cygwin uses cygdrive x foo bar to denote the path to files on drive x if x is a cyg mounted drive if the drive is unmounted cygwin uses x foo bar both conventions already screw up non cygwin programs but this is doubly annoying while both are easy enough to check for via sed the first has far less of a chance of hitting a false positive using cygpath w to translate either type of path into a regular dos path seems to work however we do not use cygpath in the cygwin wrapper script since cygpath only works on a single argument not a list of arguments instead we assume that cygdrive is used which breaks when the drive isn t cyg mounted potential solutions start using cygpath in the wrapper script this is nasty as it means invoking a separate process for each argument passed through the script skip the wrapper script altogether in the main build we use the script as little as possible it s still used for a handful of things though namely running rc perl nsinstall nsinstall is the main sore spot as it can accept a variable number of filename args which each would need to be checked nspr ldap use the wrapper pretty much everywhere hack cygpath to accept multiple args so that we could use cygpath in the wrapper in lieu of sed this means yet another entry from wintools or hoping that cygnus will accept the changes and bump the minimum rev of the cygwin tools required ,2

this bug is a regression from bug many parts of the user interface for example page info general tab in seamonkey now disregard the hour setting for time as specified in the operating system settings making mozilla no longer iso compatible due to the changes in the patch that was committed it is no longer possible for the user to specify the date and time format that they want to use across the entire interface my proposed solution is to backout the patch from bug completely since if the user wants the interface to be in a certain language including the date and time format then they should select such a language in the preferences of the operating system making it impossible for the user to make the selection in favour of supporting the full monty localisation of the application on wrongly configured operating systems is hardly acceptable and is a wrong approach in fixing bugs like which by the way remains unfixed even with the introduction of this regression that were are now discussing note that similar regressions were already noticed and brought up in bugs and but i believe they weren t given enough attention as to the cause of the problem as well as were filed in more specific and less applicable components ,2
