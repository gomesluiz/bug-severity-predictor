However, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},

These lecture notes describe a range of techniques, implemented in the R statistical environment, that allow the reader to build data cleaning scripts for data suffering from a wide range of errors and inconsistencies, in textual format. These notes cover technical as well as subject-matter related aspects of data cleaning. Technical aspects include data reading, type conversion and string matching and manipulation. Subject-matter related aspects include topics like data checking, error localization and an introduction to imputation methods in R. References to relevant literature and R packages are provided throughout.},

abstract="We present concept drift responsive method for classifier training for sequential data. Relevant instance selection for training is based on similarity to the target observation. Similarity in space and in time is combined. The algorithm determines an optimal training set size. It can be used plugging in different base classifiers. The proposed algorithm shows the best accuracy in the peer group. The algorithm complexity is reasonable for the field applications.",

abstract="On-line learning in domains where the target concept depends on some hidden context poses serious problems. A changing context can induce changes in the target concepts, producing what is known as concept drift. We describe a family of learning algorithms that flexibly react to concept drift and can take advantage of situations where contexts reappear. The general approach underlying all these algorithms consists of (1) keeping only a window of currently trusted examples and hypotheses; (2) storing concept descriptions and re-using them when a previous context re-appears; and (3) controlling both of these functions by a heuristic that constantly monitors the system's behavior. The paper reports on experiments that test the systems' performance under various conditions such as different levels of noise and different extent and rate of concept drift.",

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",
